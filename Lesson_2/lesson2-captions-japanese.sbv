0:00:00.520,0:00:04.020
So, uh, hello everybody and welcome back to

0:00:04.690,0:00:07.319
Practical deep learning for coders. This is lesson two

0:00:08.260,0:00:10.000
and

0:00:10.000,0:00:12.599
and in the last lesson we

0:00:13.570,0:00:19.500
Started training our first models. We didn't really have any idea how that training was really working

0:00:19.500,0:00:22.439
But we were looking at a high-level at what was going on

0:00:23.109,0:00:24.519
and

0:00:24.519,0:00:26.519
We learned about

0:00:26.560,0:00:28.240
what is

0:00:28.240,0:00:30.510
Machine learning and how does that work?

0:00:31.390,0:00:33.390
and

0:00:34.180,0:00:35.860
We

0:00:35.860,0:00:37.420
realized that

0:00:37.420,0:00:43.260
Based on how machine learning worked that there are some fundamental limitations on on what it can do

0:00:43.719,0:00:46.259
And we've talked about some of those limitations now

0:00:46.260,0:00:50.820
We also talked about how after you've trained a machine learning model you end up with a program

0:00:51.309,0:00:56.249
which behaves much like a normal program or something with the inputs and a thing in the middle and

0:00:56.829,0:00:58.449
outputs

0:00:58.449,0:01:00.449
so today we're gonna

0:01:00.850,0:01:02.850
finish up talking about

0:01:03.280,0:01:05.820
Talking about that and we're going to then look at how we get those

0:01:06.400,0:01:09.119
Models into production and what some of the issues with doing that?

0:01:10.000,0:01:12.000
might be I

0:01:12.939,0:01:14.939
Wanted to remind you that there are

0:01:15.369,0:01:19.438
Two sets of books. I sorry two sets of notebooks available to you

0:01:20.590,0:01:23.100
One is the the the fast book

0:01:24.009,0:01:29.249
Repo the full actual notebooks containing all the text of the O'Reilly book

0:01:30.220,0:01:32.939
and so this lets you see

0:01:33.460,0:01:35.939
Everything that I'm telling you in much more detail

0:01:36.430,0:01:43.319
And then as well as that there's the course v4 repo which contains exactly the same notebooks

0:01:43.320,0:01:46.680
But with all the pros stripped away to help you study

0:01:47.140,0:01:52.439
so that's where you really want to be doing your experiment and your practice and so maybe as you

0:01:52.780,0:01:58.949
Listen to the video. You can kind of switch back and forth between the video and reading or do one and then the other

0:01:59.530,0:02:04.320
And then put it away and have a look at the course fee for notebooks and try to remember like okay

0:02:04.320,0:02:09.239
What was this section about and run the code and see what happens and change it and so forth

0:02:11.830,0:02:13.830
So we were looking at

0:02:16.780,0:02:19.860
This line of code where we looked at how we created

0:02:20.800,0:02:22.800
our our data

0:02:23.080,0:02:26.790
by passing in information, perhaps most importantly

0:02:27.370,0:02:31.230
Some way to label the data and we talked about the importance of labeling

0:02:31.230,0:02:35.250
And in this case this particular data set whether it's a cat or a dog

0:02:35.290,0:02:39.059
You can tell by whether it's an uppercase or a lowercase letter in the first

0:02:39.970,0:02:43.139
Position that's just how this data set if they tell you when the readme works

0:02:44.320,0:02:50.699
And we are also looked particularly at this idea of valid percent equals zero point two and like what does that mean?

0:02:50.700,0:02:55.679
It creates a validation set and that was something I wanted to talk more about

0:02:56.740,0:03:00.540
The first thing I do want to do though is point out that this particular

0:03:04.330,0:03:07.320
Labeling function returns something that's either true or false

0:03:09.610,0:03:15.179
And actually this data set as we'll see later also tells also contains the actual breed of

0:03:15.910,0:03:20.429
37 different cat and dog breeds so you can you can also grab that from the filename

0:03:21.910,0:03:29.249
In each of those two cases. We're trying to predict a category. Is it a cat or is it a dog or is it a

0:03:30.190,0:03:34.739
German Shepherd or a beagle or a ragdoll cat or whatever?

0:03:35.440,0:03:42.389
When you're trying to predict a category, so when the label is a category, we call that a classification model

0:03:43.750,0:03:45.519
on the other hand

0:03:45.519,0:03:50.879
You might try to predict. How old is the animal or how tall is it?

0:03:51.640,0:03:52.959
or

0:03:52.959,0:03:58.469
Something like that, which is like a continuous number that could be like 13.2 or 26.5 or whatever

0:03:59.110,0:04:05.729
Anytime you're trying to predict a number your label is a number you call that regression, okay?

0:04:05.730,0:04:07.860
So those are the two main types of model

0:04:08.410,0:04:13.919
Classification and regressions. This is very important. Jargon to know about so the regression model

0:04:14.769,0:04:19.379
Attempts to predict one or more numeric quantities such as temperature or location or whatever

0:04:20.400,0:04:27.229
this is a bit confusing because sometimes people use the word regression as a shortcut to a particular a like a

0:04:27.810,0:04:31.310
abbreviation for a particular kind of model called linear regression

0:04:33.180,0:04:39.139
That's super confusing because that's not what regression means linear regression is just a particular kind of regression

0:04:39.419,0:04:43.189
but I just wanted to warn you of that when you start talking about regression a lot of

0:04:44.580,0:04:48.590
People will assume you're talking about linear regression even though that's not what the word means

0:04:50.790,0:04:57.589
All right, so I wanted to talk about this valid percent zero point two thing, so as we described valid percent

0:04:58.470,0:05:04.850
grabs in this case twenty percent of the data if it's zero point two and puts it aside like in a separate bucket and

0:05:05.220,0:05:07.220
Then when you train your model

0:05:07.650,0:05:10.190
Your model doesn't get to look at that data at all

0:05:10.770,0:05:17.780
That data is only used to decide to show you how accurate your model is

0:05:20.010,0:05:22.010
So if you train for too long

0:05:23.070,0:05:27.229
And or with not enough data and/or a model with too many parameters

0:05:27.599,0:05:33.889
After a while the accuracy of your model will actually get worse and this is called overfitting

0:05:34.349,0:05:38.419
Right. So we use the validation set to ensure that we're not

0:05:38.940,0:05:40.940
overfitting the

0:05:42.000,0:05:45.019
Next line of code that we looked at is this one

0:05:45.750,0:05:51.500
where we created something called a learner we'll be learning a lot more about that that a learner is basically more is

0:05:51.780,0:05:53.780
something which contains your data and

0:05:54.990,0:05:56.130
your

0:05:56.130,0:05:59.630
Architecture that is the mathematical function that you're optimizing

0:06:00.630,0:06:07.699
And so a learner is the thing that tries to figure out what are the parameters which best cause this function?

0:06:07.949,0:06:11.779
To match the labels in this data

0:06:12.449,0:06:14.689
so we're talking a lot more about that, but basically

0:06:15.240,0:06:19.760
This particular function resinate 34 is the name of a particular architecture

0:06:19.979,0:06:23.449
Which is just very good for computer vision problems

0:06:24.030,0:06:24.930
in fact

0:06:24.930,0:06:30.829
The name really is ResNet and then 34 tells you how many layers there are so you can use ones with bigger numbers

0:06:31.080,0:06:38.330
Here to get more parameters that will take to train take more memory more likely to overfit that could also

0:06:39.990,0:06:41.990
Create more complex models

0:06:42.480,0:06:46.759
Right now though. I wanted to focus on this part here, which is metrics equals error rate

0:06:47.580,0:06:54.199
this is where you list the functions that you want to be the that you want to be called with your data with your

0:06:54.330,0:06:56.330
Validation data and print it out

0:06:56.430,0:06:58.430
after each epoch and

0:06:58.770,0:07:00.120
epoch is

0:07:00.120,0:07:04.730
is what we call it when you look at every single image in the data set once and

0:07:05.670,0:07:12.259
so after you've looked at every image in the data set once we print out some information about how you're doing and

0:07:12.450,0:07:17.300
The most important thing we print out is the result of calling these metrics

0:07:17.550,0:07:23.240
so error rate is the name of a metric and it's a function that just prints out what percent of the

0:07:23.520,0:07:26.570
Validation set are being incorrectly classified by your model

0:07:28.920,0:07:34.820
So our metrics a function that measures the quality of the predictions using the validation set

0:07:35.370,0:07:40.370
So error rates one another common metric is accuracy, which is just 1 minus error rate

0:07:41.190,0:07:45.410
So very important to remember from last week. We talked about loss

0:07:46.680,0:07:53.329
Arthur Samuel had this important idea in machine learning that we need some way to figure out how

0:07:54.300,0:08:01.759
Good our how well our model is doing so that when we change the parameters we can figure out which set of parameters make that

0:08:02.880,0:08:04.880
Performance measurement get better or worse

0:08:05.190,0:08:07.669
That performance measurement is called the loss

0:08:08.190,0:08:09.900
the loss is

0:08:09.900,0:08:13.489
Not necessarily the same as your metric

0:08:14.670,0:08:19.850
the reason why is a bit subtle and we'll be seeing it in a lot of detail once we delve into the math in the

0:08:19.850,0:08:21.850
coming lessons, but basically

0:08:22.560,0:08:26.869
You need a function. You need a loss function

0:08:27.390,0:08:33.470
Where if you change the parameters by just a little bit up or just a little bit down you can see if the loss gets

0:08:33.470,0:08:39.739
A little bit better or a little bit worse and it turns out that error rate and accuracy doesn't tell you that at all

0:08:39.990,0:08:43.370
Because you might change the parameters base much such a small amount

0:08:43.920,0:08:49.499
That none of your dog's predictions start becoming hats and none of your cat predictions start becoming dogs

0:08:49.500,0:08:53.609
So like your predictions don't change and your error rate doesn't change so

0:08:54.400,0:08:59.249
Loss and metric are closely related, but the metric is the thing that you care about

0:08:59.980,0:09:07.110
The loss is the thing which your computer is using as the measurement of performance to decide how to update your parameters

0:09:08.920,0:09:10.920
So we measure

0:09:11.860,0:09:17.490
Overfitting by looking at the metrics on the validation set so fast AI

0:09:17.860,0:09:21.210
always uses the validation set to print out your metrics and

0:09:22.480,0:09:29.970
Overfitting is like the key thing that machine learning is about it's all about. How do we find a model?

0:09:30.640,0:09:37.949
Which fits the data not just for the data that we're training with but for data that the training algorithm hasn't seen before

0:09:41.170,0:09:42.760
So

0:09:42.760,0:09:43.960
overfitting

0:09:43.960,0:09:45.520
results when

0:09:45.520,0:09:47.520
our model is basically

0:09:47.890,0:09:51.059
Cheating a model can cheat by saying

0:09:51.060,0:09:51.670
Oh

0:09:51.670,0:09:56.969
I've seen this exact picture before and I remember that that's a picture of a cat

0:09:57.400,0:10:00.719
So it might not have learnt what cats look like in general

0:10:00.720,0:10:01.360
It just remembers

0:10:01.360,0:10:07.050
you know that images one four and eight cats and two and three and five dogs and

0:10:07.450,0:10:12.989
Learns nothing actually about what they really look like. So that's the kind of cheating that we're trying to avoid

0:10:12.990,0:10:14.990
we don't want it to memorize our

0:10:15.250,0:10:17.250
particular data set

0:10:17.980,0:10:19.980
So we sped off our validation data

0:10:20.530,0:10:25.559
And what most of this are these words you're seeing on the screen are from the book. Okay, so I just copied and pasted them

0:10:26.950,0:10:29.009
so if we split off our validation data

0:10:30.010,0:10:35.729
And make sure that our model sees it during training. It's completely untainted by it so we can't possibly cheat

0:10:36.790,0:10:38.849
Not quite true we can cheat

0:10:39.460,0:10:45.599
The way we could cheat is we could run we could fit a model look at the result and the validation set

0:10:46.120,0:10:48.719
Change something a little bit fit another model

0:10:48.720,0:10:52.200
Look at the validation set change something a little bit we could do that like a hundred times

0:10:53.050,0:10:55.770
Until we find something with the validation set looks the best

0:10:56.350,0:10:58.710
But now we might have fit to the validation set

0:10:59.230,0:11:04.779
Right. So if you want to be really rigorous about this, you should actually set aside a third

0:11:05.330,0:11:11.470
Bit of data called the test set that is not used for training and it's not used for your metrics

0:11:12.320,0:11:15.249
It's actually you don't look at it until the Haab projects finished

0:11:15.920,0:11:19.149
And this is what's used on competition platforms like Kegel

0:11:20.060,0:11:23.380
on Kegel after the competition finishes

0:11:24.200,0:11:26.560
Your performance will be measured

0:11:27.260,0:11:29.500
Against a data set that you have never seen

0:11:30.410,0:11:32.410
and so

0:11:32.990,0:11:34.990
That's a really helpful

0:11:35.390,0:11:40.030
Approach and it's actually a great idea to do that. Like even if you're not doing the modeling yourself

0:11:40.700,0:11:42.230
so if you're

0:11:42.230,0:11:44.529
If you're looking at vendors

0:11:44.530,0:11:51.550
And you're just trying to decide today go with IBM or Google or Microsoft and they're all showing you how great their models are

0:11:52.820,0:11:56.379
What you should do is you should say okay you go and build your models

0:11:56.780,0:12:02.019
And I am going to hang on to 10% of my data and I'm not going to let you see it at all

0:12:02.450,0:12:08.050
And when you're all finished to come back and then I'll run your model on the tip as 10% of data. You've never seen

0:12:09.320,0:12:11.320
now

0:12:12.470,0:12:14.210
Pulling out your

0:12:14.210,0:12:16.840
Validation and test sets is a bit subtle, though

0:12:17.690,0:12:22.149
here's an example of a simple little data set and this comes from a

0:12:23.000,0:12:28.419
Fantastic blog post that Rachel wrote that we will link to about creating effective validation sets

0:12:29.390,0:12:35.170
And you can see basically you have some kind of seasonal data set here. Now if you just say

0:12:35.750,0:12:38.529
okay, first day I want to model that I want to create a

0:12:39.230,0:12:43.570
My data loader using a valid percent of 0.2

0:12:44.420,0:12:48.250
It would do this. It would delete randomly some of the dots

0:12:49.190,0:12:51.190
right now

0:12:51.380,0:12:53.210
This isn't very helpful

0:12:53.210,0:12:58.449
Because it's we can still cheat because these dots are right in the middle of other dots

0:12:58.940,0:13:00.670
And this isn't what would happen in practice?

0:13:00.670,0:13:05.110
What would happen in practice is we would want to predict this is sales by date, right?

0:13:05.110,0:13:08.620
We want to predict the sales for next week. Not the sales for

0:13:09.200,0:13:12.539
14 days ago 18 days ago and 29 days ago, okay

0:13:13.089,0:13:18.178
So what you actually need to do to create an effective validation set here is not do it randomly. But instead

0:13:19.179,0:13:20.649
chop off

0:13:20.649,0:13:22.149
the end

0:13:22.149,0:13:29.368
Right. And so this is what happens in all kaggle competitions pretty much that involve time for instance is the thing that you have to

0:13:29.369,0:13:34.979
Predict is the next like two weeks or so after the last data point that they give you

0:13:35.889,0:13:38.459
And this is what you should do also for your test set

0:13:38.920,0:13:42.569
So again, if you've got vendors that you're looking at you should say to them

0:13:42.569,0:13:48.269
Okay, after you're all done modeling, we're going to check your model against a data

0:13:48.269,0:13:50.789
that is one week later than you've ever seen before and

0:13:51.339,0:13:55.018
You won't be able to retrain or anything because that's what happens in practice, right?

0:13:56.619,0:14:00.119
Oops, there's a question. I've heard people describe

0:14:00.639,0:14:07.048
Overfitting as training error being below validation error. Does this rule of thumb end up being roughly the same as yours?

0:14:07.569,0:14:09.420
Okay, so that's a great question

0:14:09.420,0:14:14.429
So I think what they mean, there is training loss versus validation loss

0:14:15.189,0:14:17.519
Because we don't print training error

0:14:18.040,0:14:24.449
so we do print at the end of each epoch the value of your loss function for the training set and the value of the

0:14:24.449,0:14:26.789
loss function for the validation set and

0:14:28.329,0:14:32.428
If you train for long enough that's so so if it's training mostly

0:14:33.160,0:14:36.449
Your training loss will go down and your validation loss will go down

0:14:37.480,0:14:39.480
because by definition

0:14:40.989,0:14:45.449
Loss function is to find such as a lower loss function is a better model

0:14:46.329,0:14:48.329
if you start overfitting

0:14:48.369,0:14:55.949
Your training loss will keep going down. Right because like why wouldn't it, you know, you're getting better and better parameters

0:14:57.790,0:15:00.360
But your validation loss will start to go up

0:15:01.149,0:15:06.928
Because actually you started fitting to the specific data points in the training set. And so it's not going to actually get better

0:15:06.929,0:15:10.319
It's going to get it's not going to get better for the validation set. It'll start to get worse

0:15:11.470,0:15:13.329
however

0:15:13.329,0:15:14.769
That does not

0:15:14.769,0:15:20.128
Necessarily mean that you're overfitting or at least not overfitting in a bad way as we'll see

0:15:20.379,0:15:23.639
It's actually possible to be at a point where the validation

0:15:24.279,0:15:30.118
Loss is getting worse but the validation accuracy or error or metric is still improving

0:15:31.269,0:15:33.220
So I'm not going to describe

0:15:33.220,0:15:37.290
How that would happen mathematically yet because we need to learn more about loss functions

0:15:37.290,0:15:43.379
But we will but for now just realize that the important thing to look at is your metric

0:15:44.110,0:15:48.389
Getting worse not your loss function getting worse

0:15:49.749,0:15:51.749
Thank you for that. Fantastic question

0:15:55.689,0:16:03.178
The next important thing we need to learn about is called transfer learning. So the next line of code said learned fine tuned

0:16:03.699,0:16:05.699
Why does it say learn dot fine to?

0:16:06.220,0:16:08.459
Fine tune is what we do when we are

0:16:08.980,0:16:16.559
Transfer learning so transfer learning is using a pre trained model for a task that is different to what it was originally trained for

0:16:16.809,0:16:23.969
So more. Jargon to understand our jargon, let's look at that. What's a pre trained model? So what happens is remember?

0:16:23.970,0:16:26.850
I told you the architecture we're using is called resonate 34

0:16:27.819,0:16:32.279
So when we take that resonate 34, that's just a just a mathematical function

0:16:32.619,0:16:37.169
Okay with lots of parameters that we're going to fit using machine learning

0:16:40.420,0:16:46.649
There's a big data set called imagenet that contains 1.3 million pictures of a thousand different types of thing

0:16:47.949,0:16:52.618
Mushrooms or animals or aeroplanes or hammers or whatever?

0:16:54.730,0:16:59.189
There's a competition or they used to be a competition that runs every year to see who could get the best

0:16:59.529,0:17:03.448
Accuracy on the imagenet competition and the models that did really well

0:17:04.240,0:17:05.889
people would take

0:17:05.889,0:17:12.359
Those specific values of those parameters and they would make them available on the internet for anybody to download

0:17:12.610,0:17:17.130
So if you download that you don't just have an architecture now you have a trained model

0:17:17.230,0:17:20.730
You have a model that can recognize a thousand

0:17:21.880,0:17:24.510
categories of thing in images

0:17:25.779,0:17:31.169
Which probably isn't very useful unless you happen to want something that recognizes those exact thousand categories of thing

0:17:32.260,0:17:34.260
But it turns out you can

0:17:36.370,0:17:42.209
Rather you can with those weights in your model and then train some more epochs

0:17:43.000,0:17:46.949
On your data and you'll end up with a far far more

0:17:47.230,0:17:53.610
Accurate model than you would if you didn't start with that pre train model and we'll see why in just a moment, right?

0:17:54.610,0:17:58.829
But this idea of transfer learning it's kind of it makes intuitive sense, right?

0:18:00.429,0:18:04.649
Imagenet already has some cats and some dogs and it's you know

0:18:04.650,0:18:06.779
It can say this is a cat and this is a dog

0:18:06.779,0:18:10.889
But you want to maybe do something that recognizes lots of breeds that aren't an image net

0:18:11.529,0:18:18.719
Well for it to be able to recognize cats versus dogs versus airplanes versus hammers. It has to understand things like

0:18:19.720,0:18:26.339
What does metal look like what is fur look like what it is look like you know so it can say like oh this breed

0:18:26.340,0:18:31.770
Of animal this breed of dog has pointy ears and oh this thing is metal. So it can't be a dog

0:18:32.529,0:18:37.709
So all these kinds of concepts get implicitly learned by a pre trained model

0:18:38.470,0:18:42.839
So if you start with a pre trained model, then you don't it. You don't have to learn all these features

0:18:43.630,0:18:47.849
from scratch and so transfer learning is the

0:18:48.370,0:18:55.679
Single most important thing for being able to use less data and less compute and get better accuracy

0:18:56.080,0:19:01.500
So that's a key focus for the FASTA eye library and a key focus for this course

0:19:03.820,0:19:10.590
There's a question and I am a bit confused on the differences between loss error and metric

0:19:14.559,0:19:16.559
Sure, so

0:19:19.029,0:19:21.029
Era is just one

0:19:21.460,0:19:27.840
Kind of metric. So there's lots of different possible labels. You could have let's say you are trying to create a model

0:19:28.360,0:19:30.599
which could predict how old a

0:19:31.240,0:19:33.220
cat or dog is

0:19:33.220,0:19:34.510
so

0:19:34.510,0:19:39.569
The metric you might use is on average how many years were you off by?

0:19:41.590,0:19:48.209
So that would be a metric on the other hand if you're trying to predict whether this is a cat or a dog

0:19:48.700,0:19:50.669
Your metric would be

0:19:50.669,0:19:52.669
What percentage of the time am I wrong?

0:19:53.230,0:20:00.809
So that latter metric is called the error rate. Okay, so error is one particular metric. It's a thing that measures

0:20:01.359,0:20:05.879
How well you're doing and it's like it should be the thing that you most care about

0:20:06.039,0:20:09.959
So you you write a function or use one of fast a i's predefined ones

0:20:11.019,0:20:13.019
Which measures how well you're doing?

0:20:15.820,0:20:17.769
Loss

0:20:17.769,0:20:22.049
Is the thing that we talked about in Lesson one, so I'll give a quick summary

0:20:22.059,0:20:24.059
But go back to lesson one if you don't remember

0:20:24.970,0:20:29.939
Arthur Samuel talked about how a machine learning model needs some measure of performance

0:20:31.269,0:20:38.638
Which we can look at when we adjust our parameters our pour down. Does that measure of performance get better or worse and

0:20:39.609,0:20:41.609
as I mentioned earlier

0:20:42.519,0:20:44.519
Some metrics

0:20:44.710,0:20:50.999
Possibly won't change at all if you move the parameters up and down just a little bit so they can't be used

0:20:51.609,0:20:56.789
For this purpose of adjusting the parameters to find a better measure of performance. So quite often

0:20:56.789,0:20:59.309
We need to use a different function

0:20:59.309,0:21:01.309
we call this the loss function and

0:21:01.389,0:21:07.139
the loss function is the measure of performance that the algorithm uses to try to make the parameters better and

0:21:07.509,0:21:13.229
It's something which should kind of track pretty closely to the the metric you care about

0:21:13.869,0:21:20.159
But it's something which as you change the parameters a bit the loss should always change a bit

0:21:20.159,0:21:21.159
and so

0:21:21.159,0:21:22.779
There's a lot of hand waving there

0:21:22.779,0:21:27.659
Because we need to look at some of the math of how that works and we'll be doing that in the next couple of lessons

0:21:31.450,0:21:33.450
Thanks to their great questions

0:21:35.499,0:21:41.579
Okay, so fine tuning is a particular transfer learning technique where the

0:21:42.519,0:21:45.508
When you're still showing your picture and not the slides

0:21:51.350,0:21:56.600
So fine-tuning is a transfer learning technique where the weights this is not quite the right word

0:21:56.600,0:22:02.809
We should say the parameters where the parameters of a pre-trained model are updated by training for additional epochs

0:22:03.030,0:22:05.689
Using a different task to that used for pre training

0:22:05.690,0:22:13.400
So pre training the tasks that have been imaged met classification and then our different tasks might be recognizing cats versus dogs

0:22:15.990,0:22:17.990
So the way

0:22:18.690,0:22:24.650
By default fast AI does fine tuning is that we use one epoch, which remember is one

0:22:25.799,0:22:32.779
looking at every image in the data set once one epoch to fit just those parts of the model necessary to

0:22:33.390,0:22:36.349
Get the particular part of the model. That's

0:22:36.870,0:22:39.409
Especially for your data set working

0:22:40.020,0:22:41.730
And then we use

0:22:41.730,0:22:44.900
as many epochs as you asked for to fit the whole model and

0:22:45.000,0:22:48.319
So this is more if you for those people who might be a bit more advanced

0:22:48.320,0:22:52.460
We'll see exactly how this works later on in the lessons

0:22:53.789,0:22:57.139
So why does transfer learning work and why does it work? So well?

0:22:58.049,0:23:04.099
the best way in my opinion to look at this is to see this paper by Zeiler and furgus who were actually

0:23:05.700,0:23:07.700
2012 imagenet winners and

0:23:08.340,0:23:09.809
interestingly

0:23:09.809,0:23:16.309
Their key insights came from their ability to visualize what's going on inside a model and so our visualization

0:23:16.470,0:23:19.459
Very often turns out to be super important to getting great results

0:23:20.520,0:23:25.489
What they were able to do was they looked remember I told you like a resinate 34 has 34 layers

0:23:26.400,0:23:28.320
They looked at

0:23:28.320,0:23:34.909
Something called Alec's net which was the previous winner of the competition, which only had seven layers at the time that was considered huge

0:23:35.580,0:23:40.580
And so they took the seven layer model and they said what is the first layer of?

0:23:40.950,0:23:46.340
Parameters look like and they figured it out how to draw a picture of them, right?

0:23:46.340,0:23:49.340
and so the first layer had

0:23:50.970,0:23:56.900
Lots and lots of features but here are nine of them. One, two, three, four, five six, seven eight nine and

0:23:57.960,0:24:00.620
Here's what nine of those pictures look like

0:24:00.620,0:24:04.219
One of them was something that could recognize diagonal lines from top left to bottom

0:24:04.470,0:24:04.960
right

0:24:04.960,0:24:08.039
One of them could find diagonal lines from bottom left to top right?

0:24:08.320,0:24:12.179
one of them could find gradients that went from the top of orange to the bottom of

0:24:12.909,0:24:18.389
Blue some of them were able, you know, one of them was specifically for finding things that were green

0:24:19.030,0:24:22.530
And so forth right so for each of these nine

0:24:24.549,0:24:26.939
They're called filters there are features

0:24:28.659,0:24:32.009
So then something really interesting they did was they looked at for each one of these

0:24:32.799,0:24:38.999
Each one of these filters each one of these features and we'll learn kind of mathematically about what these actually mean

0:24:39.730,0:24:41.650
In the coming lessons, but for now

0:24:41.650,0:24:46.169
Let's just recognize them and saying oh there's something that looks at diagonal lines and something that looks at gradients

0:24:46.690,0:24:50.280
And they found in the actual images in imagenet

0:24:52.390,0:24:59.339
Specific examples of parts of photos that match that filter so for this top left filter here are nine

0:25:00.130,0:25:04.559
actual patches of real photos that match that filter and as you can see

0:25:04.559,0:25:11.399
They're all diagonal lines. And so here's the four the green one. Here's parts of actual photos that match the green one

0:25:11.950,0:25:18.210
So layer one is super super simple. And one of the interesting things to note here. Is that something that can recognize?

0:25:18.730,0:25:24.030
Gradients and patches of color and lines is likely to be useful for lots of other tasks as well

0:25:24.030,0:25:28.169
Not just imagenet so you can kind of see how something that can do this

0:25:29.020,0:25:31.020
might also be good at

0:25:31.419,0:25:34.079
Many many other computer vision tasks as well

0:25:35.380,0:25:37.380
This is layer 2 layer

0:25:37.390,0:25:41.579
2 takes the features of layer 1 and combines them

0:25:42.429,0:25:48.029
so it can not just find edges that can find corners or

0:25:49.299,0:25:57.089
Repeating curving patterns or semi circles or full circles. And so you can see for example, here's a

0:25:58.990,0:26:02.760
It's kind of hard to exactly visualize these

0:26:04.419,0:26:09.359
Layers after layer 1 you kind of have to show examples of what the filters look like

0:26:10.150,0:26:17.009
but here you can see examples of parts of photos that these this layer 2 circular filter has

0:26:17.840,0:26:19.840
activated on

0:26:20.030,0:26:22.869
And as you can see, it's found things with circles

0:26:23.390,0:26:30.490
so interestingly this one which is this kind of blotchy gradient seems to be very good at finding sunsets and

0:26:30.950,0:26:35.649
this repeating vertical pattern is very good at finding like curtains and wheat

0:26:36.380,0:26:38.330
fields and stuff

0:26:38.330,0:26:44.139
So the further we get layer three then gets to combine all the kinds of features in layer

0:26:44.540,0:26:50.920
Two and remember, we're only seeing Zoar anything here are twelve of the features, but actually there's probably hundreds of them

0:26:50.920,0:26:53.320
I don't remember exactly an alux net, but there's lots

0:26:53.750,0:27:00.700
But by the time we get to layer three by combining features from layer two, it already has something which is finding

0:27:01.700,0:27:06.189
Text so this is a feature which can find bits of image that contain text

0:27:07.130,0:27:09.130
It's already got something which can find

0:27:10.130,0:27:13.780
repeating geometric patterns and you see this is not just like a

0:27:15.710,0:27:18.340
Matching specific pixel patterns. This is like a

0:27:19.190,0:27:24.249
Semantic concept it can find repeating circles or repeating squares or repeating hexagons

0:27:24.920,0:27:28.450
Great, so it's it's really like computing. It's not just

0:27:29.240,0:27:36.700
Matching a template and remember we know that neural networks can solve any possible computable function so it can certainly do that

0:27:38.960,0:27:41.710
So layer four gets to combine

0:27:42.290,0:27:48.489
All the filters from layer three anyway at once and so by layer four, we have something that can find dog faces

0:27:49.220,0:27:51.220
for instance

0:27:51.470,0:27:53.470
so you can kind of see how

0:27:54.410,0:27:59.499
Each layer, we get like more applicative lis more sophisticated features

0:27:59.630,0:28:04.360
And so that's why these deep neural networks can be so incredibly powerful

0:28:05.150,0:28:11.200
It's also why transfer learning can work so well because like if we wanted something that can find

0:28:11.990,0:28:15.550
Books, and I don't think there's a book category in imagenet

0:28:15.680,0:28:21.549
Well, it's actually already got something that can find text as an earlier filter, which I guess it must be using to find

0:28:21.560,0:28:24.700
Maybe there's a category for library or something or a bookshelf

0:28:26.390,0:28:32.660
So when you use transfer learning you can take advantage of all of these pre I learnt

0:28:33.150,0:28:38.089
Features to find things that are as combinations of these or existing features

0:28:38.310,0:28:45.440
That's why transfer learning can be done so much more quickly and so much less data than traditional approaches

0:28:47.250,0:28:53.119
One important thing to realize then is that these techniques for computer vision are not just good at

0:28:53.700,0:28:55.170
recognizing photos

0:28:55.170,0:29:01.430
There's all kinds of things you can turn into pictures. For example, these are example these are

0:29:01.980,0:29:08.329
sounds that have been tuned into pictures by representing their frequencies over time and

0:29:09.120,0:29:13.880
It turns out that if you convert a sound into these kinds of pictures

0:29:14.580,0:29:18.380
You can get basically state-of-the-art results at sound detection

0:29:19.260,0:29:22.489
Just by using the exact same resonate

0:29:23.160,0:29:25.160
learner that we've already seen

0:29:25.860,0:29:29.449
We need to highlight that it's 945. So if you want to take a break soon

0:29:30.720,0:29:32.720
a really cool example

0:29:33.000,0:29:37.640
From I think this is our very first year of running fast AI one of our students

0:29:38.880,0:29:45.499
Created pictures they worked at Splunk in anti-fraud and they created pictures of users moving their mouths

0:29:45.500,0:29:48.530
And if I remember correctly as they moved their mouths

0:29:48.740,0:29:55.310
He basically drew a picture of where the mouse moved and the color depended on how fast they moved and these

0:29:55.830,0:29:59.630
circular blobs is where they clicked the left or the right mouse button and

0:30:00.570,0:30:05.389
It's blank. They then well, he what he did actually for the through the course as a

0:30:06.210,0:30:12.560
Project for the course is he tried to see whether he could use this these pictures with exactly the same approach?

0:30:12.560,0:30:17.839
We saw in lesson 1 to create an anti fraud model and it worked

0:30:17.840,0:30:24.620
So well that Splunk ended up patenting a new product based on this technique and you can actually check it out

0:30:24.620,0:30:30.859
there's a blog post about it on the internet where they describe this breakthrough anti-fraud approach which literally came from

0:30:32.190,0:30:37.219
One of our really amazing and brilliant and creative students after lesson one of the course

0:30:39.180,0:30:43.580
Another cool example of this is looking at different

0:30:44.880,0:30:46.380
viruses and

0:30:46.380,0:30:51.109
Again, turning them into pictures and you can kind of see how they've got here. This is from a paper

0:30:51.630,0:30:53.630
Check out the book for the citation

0:30:54.240,0:30:58.729
they've got three examples of a particular virus called VB 80 and another

0:30:59.070,0:31:05.179
example of a particular virus called fake rien and you can see each case the pictures all look kind of similar and

0:31:05.850,0:31:06.800
That's why again

0:31:06.800,0:31:11.900
they can get state-of-the-art results in in virus detection by turning the

0:31:12.300,0:31:16.610
Kind of program signatures into pictures and putting it through image recognition

0:31:20.040,0:31:25.820
So in the book you'll find a list of all of the terms all of the most important terms

0:31:25.820,0:31:29.270
We've seen both so far and what they mean. I'm not going to read through them

0:31:29.270,0:31:35.270
but I want you to please because these are the these are the terms that we're going to be using from now on and

0:31:35.520,0:31:37.520
You've got to know what they mean

0:31:37.710,0:31:43.789
because if you don't you're going to be really confused because I'll be talking about labels and architectures and models and parameters and

0:31:44.130,0:31:50.359
They have very specific exact meanings and they'll be using those exact meanings. So please review this

0:31:51.990,0:31:58.909
So to remind you this is where we got to we we ended up with Arthur Samuels overall

0:31:59.970,0:32:05.299
Approach and we replaced his terms with our terms. So we have an architecture

0:32:05.970,0:32:12.380
Which contains parameters as inputs and we more parameters and the data as inputs?

0:32:13.200,0:32:16.669
So that the architecture press the parameters of the model

0:32:17.850,0:32:20.480
With the inputs they used to calculate predictions

0:32:20.820,0:32:26.990
They are compared to the labels with a loss function and that loss function is used to update the parameters

0:32:27.600,0:32:32.449
Many many times to make them better and better until the loss gets nice and super low

0:32:34.890,0:32:37.279
So this is the end of chapter 1 of the book

0:32:38.010,0:32:44.059
it's really important to look at the questionnaire because the questionnaire is the thing where you can check whether you

0:32:45.640,0:32:52.020
Have taken away from this book of this chapter the stuff that we hope you have so go through it and

0:32:53.380,0:32:57.599
Anything that you're not sure about the tech that the answer is in the text

0:32:57.640,0:33:02.640
So just go back to earlier in the book and you will in the chapter and you will find the answers

0:33:04.390,0:33:10.950
There's also a further research section after each questionnaire for the first couple of chapters, they're actually pretty simple

0:33:11.050,0:33:16.380
Hopefully they're pretty fun and interesting. They're things were to answer the question. It's not enough to just look in the chapter

0:33:16.900,0:33:22.410
You actually have to go and do your own thinking and experimenting and googling and so forth

0:33:23.260,0:33:30.600
In later chapters, some of these further research things are pretty significant projects that might take a few days or even weeks

0:33:31.210,0:33:32.980
and so

0:33:32.980,0:33:35.939
yeah, you know check them out because hopefully they'll be a great way to

0:33:36.820,0:33:38.820
Expand your understanding of the material

0:33:41.200,0:33:45.990
So something that still found points out in the book is that if you really want to make the most of this

0:33:46.150,0:33:47.550
then after each chapter

0:33:47.550,0:33:54.419
Please take the time to experiment with your own project and within the books you provide we provide and then see if you can

0:33:55.090,0:33:59.699
Redo the the notebooks on a new data set and perhaps for chapter one

0:33:59.700,0:34:04.169
That might be a bit hard because we haven't really shown how to change things but for chapter four chapter two

0:34:04.540,0:34:07.440
Which we're going to start next you'll absolutely be able to do that

0:34:08.920,0:34:15.089
Okay, so let's take a break and we'll come back at 9:55

0:34:16.390,0:34:18.390
San Francisco time

0:34:18.970,0:34:25.770
Okay, so welcome back everybody and I think we've got a couple of questions to start with. So Rachel, please take it away. Sure

0:34:26.530,0:34:29.130
Our filters independent by that

0:34:29.130,0:34:35.430
I mean if filters are pre-trained might they become less good and detecting features of previous images when fine-tuned. Oh

0:34:36.340,0:34:38.340
That is a great question

0:34:39.460,0:34:47.310
So assuming I understand the question correctly if if you start with say an image NIT model and then you you fine-tune it on

0:34:47.890,0:34:54.299
Dogs versus cats for a few epochs and you get something that's very good at recognizing dogs versus cats

0:34:56.380,0:34:58.900
It's got to be much less good as an image net model after that

0:34:58.910,0:35:03.879
So it's not going to be very good at recognizing aeroplanes or or hammers or whatever

0:35:05.810,0:35:07.810
This is called catastrophic

0:35:07.850,0:35:12.190
Forgetting in the literature the idea that as you like see more images

0:35:12.260,0:35:16.960
About different things to what you saw earlier that you start to forget what the things you saw earlier?

0:35:18.860,0:35:22.150
So if you want to fine-tune something which is

0:35:22.850,0:35:27.009
Good at a new task but also continues to be good at the previous task

0:35:27.010,0:35:30.700
You need to keep putting in examples of the previous task as well

0:35:33.800,0:35:38.890
And what are the example what are the differences between parameters and hyper parameters

0:35:40.070,0:35:46.150
If I am feeding an image of a dog as an input and then changing the hyper parameters of batch size and the model

0:35:46.280,0:35:48.370
What would be an example of a parameter?

0:35:49.880,0:35:52.150
So the parameters are the things that

0:35:53.540,0:35:58.240
are described in lesson one that Arthur Samuel described as being

0:35:59.870,0:36:01.870
The things which change

0:36:02.060,0:36:08.769
What the model does what the architecture does so we start with this infinitely flexible function

0:36:08.770,0:36:11.860
The thing called a neural network that can do anything at all

0:36:12.860,0:36:14.600
and

0:36:14.600,0:36:15.740
the

0:36:15.740,0:36:21.009
The way you get it to do one thing versus another thing is by changing its parameters. They're there

0:36:21.010,0:36:27.070
They are the numbers that you pass into that function. So there's two types of numbers you pass into the function

0:36:27.070,0:36:34.059
There's the numbers that represent your input like the pixels of your dog. And there's the numbers that represent

0:36:35.720,0:36:37.720
Their learnt parameters

0:36:38.150,0:36:42.430
So in the example of something that's not a neural net but like a checkers playing program

0:36:43.070,0:36:49.330
Like Arthur Samuel might have used back in the early 60s and late 50s. Those parameters may have been things like

0:36:50.600,0:36:52.600
if there is a

0:36:53.240,0:36:57.099
Opportunity to take a piece versus an opportunity to get to the end of a board

0:36:57.950,0:37:01.599
How much more value should I consider one versus the other?

0:37:01.870,0:37:07.120
You know, it's twice as important or it's three times as important that two versus three, that would be an example of a parameter

0:37:09.060,0:37:10.410
In a

0:37:10.410,0:37:12.000
neural network

0:37:12.000,0:37:19.069
Parameters are a much more abstract concept and so a detailed understanding of what they are will come in the next lesson or two

0:37:19.590,0:37:23.990
But it's the same basic idea there the numbers which change

0:37:25.020,0:37:28.640
What the model does to be something that recognizes?

0:37:29.550,0:37:35.060
malignant tumors versus cats versus dogs versus colorizer splack and white pictures

0:37:36.810,0:37:38.810
Whereas the hyper parameter is

0:37:39.420,0:37:41.420
the choices about

0:37:41.940,0:37:43.110
What?

0:37:43.110,0:37:49.670
What numbers do you pass to the function when you act the actual fitting function to decide how that fitting process happens?

0:37:50.580,0:37:52.020
it

0:37:52.020,0:37:57.140
There's a question. I'm curious about the pacing of this course. I'm concerned that all the material may not be covered

0:37:58.350,0:38:02.420
It depends what you mean by all the material we certainly won't cover everything in the world

0:38:03.720,0:38:05.720
So yeah

0:38:07.110,0:38:10.370
We'll cover what we can well cover what we can in seven lessons

0:38:11.790,0:38:18.440
We're certainly not covering the whole book if that's what you're wondering. The whole book will be covered in either two or three courses

0:38:19.320,0:38:23.600
In the past. It's generally been two courses to cover about the amount of stuff in the book

0:38:24.750,0:38:28.909
But we'll see how it goes because the books pretty big 500 pages

0:38:29.190,0:38:32.569
So when you say two courses you mean fourteen lesson 14

0:38:32.570,0:38:35.870
Yes, it would be like 14 or 21 lessons to get through the whole book

0:38:37.530,0:38:39.740
Well, though having said that by the end of the first lesson

0:38:39.840,0:38:45.350
Hopefully there'll be kind of like enough momentum and understanding that the reading the book independently will be more

0:38:45.780,0:38:47.930
useful and you'll have also kind of

0:38:49.200,0:38:54.049
Gained a community of folks on the forums that you can hang out with and ask questions of and so forth

0:38:56.580,0:39:03.620
So in in the second part of the course, we're going to be talking about putting stuff in production and

0:39:05.280,0:39:09.830
We're so to do that we need to understand like what are the capabilities and limitations of

0:39:11.100,0:39:13.100
Deep learning what are the kinds of?

0:39:13.290,0:39:16.250
projects that even makes sense to try to put in production

0:39:17.100,0:39:20.809
And you know one of the key things I should mention in the book and in this core

0:39:20.940,0:39:23.669
Is that the first two or three lessons and chapters?

0:39:24.310,0:39:27.600
there's a lot of stuff which is designed not just for

0:39:28.150,0:39:33.359
the coders but for for everybody there's lots of information about like

0:39:34.270,0:39:37.409
What are the practical things you need to know to make deep learning work?

0:39:37.450,0:39:42.329
And so one of them things you need to know is like well what's deep learning actually good at at the moment

0:39:43.870,0:39:46.740
So I'll summarize what the book says about this but

0:39:47.560,0:39:50.250
there are the kind of four key areas that we

0:39:51.100,0:39:54.539
Have as applications in faster a computer vision text

0:39:54.850,0:40:02.309
Tabular and what I've called here XE assistance for recommendation systems and specifically a technique called collaborative filtering which we briefly saw

0:40:02.890,0:40:10.589
Sorry, another question and is are there any pre trained weights available other than the ones from imagenet that we can use if?

0:40:10.750,0:40:14.520
Yes, when should we use others in one imagenet? Oh, that's a really great question

0:40:15.370,0:40:16.810
so

0:40:16.810,0:40:20.730
yes, there are a lot of pre trained models and

0:40:21.370,0:40:26.280
One way to find them. But also you're currently just showing us what you can great

0:40:27.370,0:40:29.819
Now one great way to find them is you can look up

0:40:31.540,0:40:33.540
Models ooh

0:40:33.580,0:40:38.430
Which is a common name for like places that have lots of different models

0:40:39.760,0:40:43.289
And so here's lots of models is or you can look for

0:40:44.920,0:40:46.920
Pre-trained models

0:40:49.030,0:40:53.609
And so yeah, there's quite a few um, unfortunately

0:40:55.750,0:41:03.599
Not as wide a variety as I would like that most is still on image net or similar kinds of general photos

0:41:04.240,0:41:06.689
for example medical imaging there's hardly any

0:41:08.980,0:41:14.010
There's a lot of opportunities for people to create domain-specific pre-trained models, it's it's still an area

0:41:14.010,0:41:17.549
That's really underdone because not enough people are working on transfer learning

0:41:20.569,0:41:27.489
Okay, so as I was mentioning we've kind of got these four applications that we've talked about a bit

0:41:28.880,0:41:34.569
And deep learning is pretty, you know, pretty good at all of those

0:41:36.529,0:41:43.268
Tabular data like spreadsheets and database tables is an area where dick learning is not always the best choice

0:41:43.549,0:41:47.528
But it's particularly good for things involving high cardinality variables

0:41:47.599,0:41:52.509
that means variables that have like lots and lots of discrete levels like zip code or

0:41:53.059,0:41:55.239
Product ID or something like that

0:41:56.079,0:41:59.349
deep loadings really pretty great for those in particular

0:42:02.779,0:42:07.599
For text it's pretty great at things like classification and translation

0:42:08.059,0:42:14.169
It's actually terrible for conversation. And so that's that's been something that's been a huge disappointment for a lot of companies

0:42:14.170,0:42:16.359
I tried to create these like conversation BOTS

0:42:17.299,0:42:19.509
but actually deep learning isn't good at

0:42:20.329,0:42:22.309
providing accurate information

0:42:22.309,0:42:26.319
it's good at providing things that sound accurate and sound compelling but

0:42:26.390,0:42:29.680
That we don't really have great ways yet of actually making sure it's correct

0:42:33.559,0:42:37.959
One big issue for recommendation systems collaborative filtering is that

0:42:38.960,0:42:41.019
Deep learning is focused on making predictions

0:42:42.259,0:42:48.459
Which don't necessarily actually mean creating useful recommendations. We'll see what that means in a moment

0:42:49.789,0:42:52.569
Deep learning is also good at multimodal

0:42:53.269,0:42:55.269
That means things where you've got

0:42:55.970,0:43:02.139
Multiple different types of data so you might have some tabular data including a text column and an image

0:43:03.650,0:43:05.710
Then some collaborative filtering data

0:43:06.349,0:43:09.699
And combining that all together is something that deep learning is really good at

0:43:10.519,0:43:12.519
so for example

0:43:13.309,0:43:19.569
Putting captions on photos is something which deep learning is pretty good at although again

0:43:19.569,0:43:21.289
It's not very good at being accurate

0:43:21.289,0:43:26.289
So what you know might say this is a picture of two birds when it's actually a picture of three birds

0:43:27.829,0:43:29.829
And then this other category

0:43:30.880,0:43:31.930
there's

0:43:31.930,0:43:38.550
Lots and lots of things that you can do with deep learning by being creative about the use of these kinds of other

0:43:39.160,0:43:46.080
Application based approaches for example an approach that we developed for natural language processing called you LM fit

0:43:46.080,0:43:48.080
They're all you're learning in the course

0:43:48.670,0:43:55.200
It turns out that it's also fantastic you're doing protein analysis. If you think of the different proteins as being different words

0:43:56.200,0:44:00.030
And they're in a sequence which has some kind of state and meaning

0:44:00.490,0:44:07.409
It turns out that you will M fit works really well for protein analysis so often it's about kind of being being creative

0:44:08.350,0:44:13.649
So to decide like for the product that you're trying to build is deep learning gonna work

0:44:14.290,0:44:17.969
Well for it in the end you kind of just have to try it and see

0:44:20.800,0:44:26.370
But if you if you do a search, you know, hopefully you can find examples about the people that have tried something similar

0:44:27.040,0:44:30.060
Even if you can't that doesn't mean it's not going to work

0:44:31.780,0:44:38.790
So, for example, I mentioned the collaborative filtering issue where a recommendation and a prediction are not necessarily the same thing

0:44:39.310,0:44:41.310
You can see this on

0:44:41.440,0:44:45.870
Amazon for example quite often so I bought a terry pratchet book and

0:44:46.210,0:44:50.610
Then Amazon tried for months to get me to buy more terry pratchet books

0:44:50.830,0:44:58.620
now that must be because their predictive model said that people who bought one particular terry patcher book are likely to also by

0:44:58.620,0:45:00.520
other terry pratchet books

0:45:00.520,0:45:04.530
But from the point of view of like well is this going to change my buying behavior?

0:45:05.200,0:45:07.800
Probably not right like if I liked that book

0:45:07.800,0:45:11.999
I already know I like that author and I already know that like they probably wrote other things

0:45:12.000,0:45:15.510
So I'll go and buy it anyway, so this would be an example of like Amazon

0:45:16.450,0:45:19.980
Probably not being very smart up here. They're actually showing me

0:45:20.680,0:45:25.919
Collaborative filtering predictions rather than actually figuring out how to optimize a recommendation

0:45:26.500,0:45:30.510
So an optimized recommendation would be something more like your local

0:45:31.120,0:45:35.399
Human bookseller might do where they might say. Oh you like Terry Pratchett

0:45:35.770,0:45:42.840
Well, let me tell you about other kind of comedy fantasy sci-fi writers on the similar vein who you might not have heard about before

0:45:44.200,0:45:49.139
So the difference between recommendations and predictions is super important

0:45:50.619,0:45:55.079
so I wanted to talk about a really important issue around interpreting models and

0:45:56.170,0:46:01.200
For a case study for this I thought we let's pick something that's actually super important right now

0:46:01.530,0:46:03.689
Which is a model in this paper?

0:46:03.690,0:46:06.960
One of the things we're going to try and do in this course is learn how to read papers

0:46:07.720,0:46:11.730
というわけで、皆さんに読んでいただきたいのがこちらの論文です。

0:46:12.310,0:46:18.179
高温多湿がCOVID-19の感染を減少させるという論文で、これは非常に重要な問題です.

0:46:18.730,0:46:21.419
もしこの論文の主張が本当ならば、

0:46:21.420,0:46:23.420
これは季節性の病気であることを意味し、

0:46:23.530,0:46:29.159
もしこれが季節性の病気であれば、大規模な政策的な意味合いを持つことになります。

0:46:30.880,0:46:36.540
これがどのようにモデル化されたのかを調べて、このモデルをどのように解釈するかを理解しましょう。

0:46:38.590,0:46:40.590
これが

0:46:41.530,0:46:45.659
論文からの重要な図です。

0:46:46.270,0:46:51.119
彼らは中国の100の都市の気温を1つの軸に摂氏でプロットし

0:46:51.490,0:47:00.970
もう1つの軸にはRをプロットしました。 Rは感染性の尺度です。各人がこの病気に感染した場合

0:47:00.970,0:47:02.970
平均で何人を感染させるかを表しています。

0:47:03.790,0:47:09.749
つまり、Rが1以下であれば、この病気は広まりません。

0:47:10.720,0:47:14.010
もしＲが２より高ければ 信じられないほど早く広がります。

0:47:15.369,0:47:20.459
基本的に、Rが高くなると、指数関数的に感染が拡大します。

0:47:21.670,0:47:28.240
このケースでは、ここに最適な線をプロットしています。

0:47:28.240,0:47:30.750
そして、彼らは、

0:47:32.260,0:47:38.699
Rは1.99から0.023かける温度を引いたものであるという公式に基づいて、ある特定の関係があると主張しています。

0:47:39.760,0:47:41.470
ここで

0:47:41.470,0:47:45.780
この図を見ていて私が懸念しているのは、

0:47:47.560,0:47:53.340
これは単なるランダムなものかもしれない、もしかしたら全く関係がないのかもしれない、ということです。

0:47:54.010,0:47:58.709
100の都市をランダムに選ぶと、この程度の関係性を示すことがあるのかもしれません。

0:48:00.160,0:48:08.859
それを確かめる簡単な方法としては、実際にスプレッドシートを使ってみるという方法があります。

0:48:08.859,0:48:16.619
これがスプレッドシートです。 ここで私がやったのは、このデータを見て、平均気温が何度かを推測してみました。

0:48:16.839,0:48:24.029
約5度だと思います。 摂氏の標準偏差は？　たぶん同じように5くらいだと思います。

0:48:24.819,0:48:28.979
そして、Rについても同じことをしました。平均Rは私には

0:48:29.260,0:48:34.020
1.9くらいに見えます。 そして、Rの標準偏差はおそらく0.5くらいだと思います。

0:48:35.589,0:48:40.409
そこで、私はここにジャンプして、

0:48:41.440,0:48:42.819
ランダムな

0:48:42.819,0:48:47.519
正規値、つまり正規分布からのランダムな値を作成しました。

0:48:47.530,0:48:53.849
つまり温度の特定の平均と標準偏差とRの特定の平均と標準偏差の

0:48:54.339,0:48:59.699
ベルカーブです。 これは架空の

0:49:00.549,0:49:02.020
100の都市の

0:49:02.020,0:49:07.889
データセットの中にあるかもしれない都市の例です。摂氏9度、Rが1.1の都市。

0:49:07.890,0:49:13.349
摂氏9度、Rが1.1で、このあたりになります。

0:49:14.950,0:49:18.359
だから、この式を100回

0:49:20.380,0:49:22.380
コピーしました。

0:49:22.420,0:49:25.290
ここに中国にあるかもしれない

0:49:25.960,0:49:31.889
100の都市がありますが、これは気温とRの間に

0:49:32.260,0:49:35.010
関係がないと仮定した、ただのランダムな数値です。

0:49:36.490,0:49:37.690
そして

0:49:37.690,0:49:43.290
だから再計算するたびに（コントロール・イコールを押すと再計算されます）

0:49:44.290,0:49:46.290
ランダムなので、違う数字が出てきます。

0:49:46.839,0:49:49.979
上の方には、

0:49:50.740,0:49:52.740
全温度の平均と

0:49:54.579,0:49:59.339
全Rの平均。全ての温度の

0:50:02.290,0:50:07.290
平均値が変化し、Rも同様に変化します。そこで

0:50:09.040,0:50:12.119
私がしたのはこれらの乱数をここに

0:50:14.530,0:50:16.530
コピーしたことです。

0:50:17.230,0:50:23.490
実際にやってみましょう。100個の乱数をコピーして

0:50:25.960,0:50:27.760
ここと、

0:50:27.760,0:50:33.389
ここと、 ここと、 こことに貼り付けます。これで

0:50:34.839,0:50:40.979
1 2 3 4 5 6 100個の都市のグループが６つできました。

0:50:41.289,0:50:43.559
これでこれ以上

0:50:45.220,0:50:51.359
ランダムに変化しないように固定しておきます。

0:50:57.789,0:51:00.329
さて、これで貼り付けました。

0:51:01.030,0:51:08.489
気温とRの関係が全くないとしたら、100の都市はどのようになるのか、6つの例が出てきました。

0:51:09.579,0:51:13.589
これら6つの例の平均温度とRはここにあります。

0:51:13.630,0:51:19.079
私がした事は、これを見て下さい、最初の例をプロットしました。

0:51:19.630,0:51:22.710
この場合、実際には

0:51:23.680,0:51:25.680
若干、プラスの傾きがあります。

0:51:26.500,0:51:28.500
私は実際に、

0:51:30.549,0:51:32.549
それぞれの傾きを

0:51:33.010,0:51:38.010
Microsoft Excelの傾き関数を使って計算しました。見ての通り、

0:51:39.430,0:51:41.430
この特定のケースでは、 ただランダムであることがわかります。

0:51:42.460,0:51:44.490
5回は

0:51:45.369,0:51:47.818
負の値を示しています。そして、それは彼らの

0:51:48.460,0:51:50.460
0.023よりもさらに負の値を示しています。

0:51:50.559,0:51:55.109
このように、私たちの直感と一致しています。

0:51:55.109,0:51:58.499
つまり、この線の傾きは、完全に

0:51:59.829,0:52:07.079
偶然に起こることが多いということです。 実際の関係を示しているようには見えません。

0:52:07.990,0:52:11.819
もし、この傾きを

0:52:12.490,0:52:18.689
もっと自信を持って示したいのであれば、もっと多くの都市を 調べる必要があります。

0:52:21.549,0:52:27.149
ここに3,000個のランダムに生成された数字があります。この傾きは

0:52:28.930,0:52:35.760
0.00002であるのがわかりますね？これは我々の期待通りほぼ0です。実際にCとRの間には関係がない場合、

0:52:35.760,0:52:37.949
これらはランダムに生成された数字で関係がありません。

0:52:38.740,0:52:44.219
そして、ランダムに生成されたたくさんの都市のデータを見てみると、「ああ、そうだ、傾きはない」と言えるでしょう。

0:52:44.590,0:52:49.379
しかし、今回のように１００個の都市だけを見た場合には、非常に多くの場合、

0:52:51.010,0:52:58.139
全く偶然に関係性があることがわかります。だから、それを測定する必要があります。

0:52:58.690,0:53:01.649
これを測定する一つの方法は、p値と呼ばれるものを使うことです。

0:53:02.590,0:53:05.159
p値、ここではp値がどのように機能するかを説明します。

0:53:05.470,0:53:12.600
まず帰無仮説と呼ばれるものから始めます。帰無仮説とは、基本的には出発点の

0:53:13.270,0:53:16.800
仮定のことです。 例えば我々の出発点の仮定は、

0:53:16.800,0:53:24.179
温度とRの間には何の関係もないというものかもしれません。そして、いくつかのデータを集めて、（レイチェル：Rとは何か説明してくれましたか？ ジェレミー：はい、しました)

0:53:24.390,0:53:26.390
Rはウイルスの透過性です。

0:53:28.180,0:53:35.310
そして、独立変数と従属変数のデータを収集します。 この場合、独立変数とは、

0:53:36.130,0:53:43.290
従属変数を引き起こすと思われるものです。ここでは、独立変数は温度で、従属変数はRです。ここでデータを収集しました。

0:53:43.990,0:53:46.379
この例で収集したデータはこれです。

0:53:46.380,0:53:51.960
そして、何％の割合でこれくらいの関連性を偶然で見ることがあるでしょうか？

0:53:51.960,0:53:55.830
ここでは0.023の傾きです。

0:53:56.260,0:54:00.090
これまで見てきたように、これを行う1つの方法は、いわゆる

0:54:00.190,0:54:07.260
シミュレーションと呼ばれるもので、乱数を生成して、100組の乱数のペアを何回か繰り返して、この関係がどのくらいの頻度で

0:54:07.510,0:54:09.600
見られるかを計測するというものです。

0:54:11.140,0:54:13.830
しかし、実際にそれをする必要はありません。実際には、

0:54:14.710,0:54:22.290
which is what percent of the time would we see that relationship by chance?
この数値を求めるのに使える簡単な方程式があります。ここ言えば、その関係性を偶然見てしまうのは何％なのかです。

0:54:25.150,0:54:27.150
そして

0:54:27.580,0:54:31.110
これは基本的にはこのようになります。ここに「最も可能性の高い観測」がありますが、

0:54:31.780,0:54:37.439
この場合、温度との間に関係がなければ、

0:54:37.590,0:54:40.410
最も可能性の高い傾きはゼロという事。

0:54:41.410,0:54:47.039
偶然、正の傾きが得られることもあれば、

0:54:48.160,0:54:50.219
かなり小さな傾きが得られることもあり、

0:54:51.010,0:54:54.180
また時には大きな負の傾きが得られます。

0:54:54.520,0:54:55.410
このように、

0:54:55.410,0:55:00.569
数字が大きくなるほど、それが正の側であろうと負の側であろうと、その可能性は低くなります。

0:55:00.910,0:55:02.969
私たちの場合、疑問だったのは

0:55:04.390,0:55:10.529
どのくらいの頻度で0.023以下の負の値を得ることができるのか。それは実際にはこの辺のどこかになるでしょう。

0:55:10.930,0:55:14.430
実はこれをウィキペディアからコピーしたのですが、正の数字を探していたので、

0:55:14.560,0:55:18.090
数字の上のこの部分に色をつけています。

0:55:18.370,0:55:25.380
これがp値です。数学は気にしていませんが、この数値、つまりp値を

0:55:25.960,0:55:27.960
データから直接計算するのに使える 

0:55:28.780,0:55:32.460
簡単な小さな方程式があります。

0:55:34.360,0:55:37.589
これは、ほとんどすべての

0:55:38.710,0:55:41.879
医学研究の結果がこのような形で示される傾向があり、

0:55:42.850,0:55:47.519
人々はこのp値という考えに注目します。実際に、この特定の研究でも、

0:55:48.220,0:55:51.090
後ほどご紹介するように、p値が報告されています。

0:55:52.120,0:55:57.539
おそらく、多くの人が以前p値を見たことがあるでしょう。それらは様々な分野で出てきます。

0:55:59.110,0:56:01.110
ここからが問題なのですが、

0:56:01.180,0:56:05.039
これはひどいものです。使うべきではありません。

0:56:05.950,0:56:09.119
私だけを信用しないでください。アメリカ統計協会を信じて下さい。

0:56:10.330,0:56:12.870
彼らはp値について6つのことを指摘しています。

0:56:13.570,0:56:19.529
その中には次のようなものがあります。p値は仮説が真である確率を測るものでも、

0:56:20.080,0:56:23.610
あるいはデータがランダムな選択だけで作られた確率を測るものでもない、ということです。

0:56:24.040,0:56:31.110
これは今学んだように、より多くのデータを使用した場合、

0:56:32.020,0:56:37.350
100の都市ではなく3000の都市を無作為にサンプリングした場合、

0:56:38.080,0:56:43.080
得られる値ははるかに小さくなるのです。つまり、p値は関係性の大きさを教えてくれるだけではなく、

0:56:43.090,0:56:48.539
実際にはそれらを組み合わせて、どれだけのデータを収集したかを教えてくれるのです。

0:56:49.060,0:56:53.039
つまり、仮説が真である確率を測定するものではないのです。

0:56:54.430,0:56:59.610
したがって、結論や政策決定は、P値がある閾値を通過したかどうかに基づいて行われるべきではありません。

0:57:02.500,0:57:04.500
P値は結果の重要性を

0:57:04.780,0:57:06.780
測定するものではありません。

0:57:07.150,0:57:10.349
なぜなら、繰り返しになりますが、P値は、あなたが多くのデータを収集したことを教えてくれるだけで、

0:57:10.810,0:57:18.269
結果が実際に実用的なものであることを教えてくれるわけではないからです。それは証拠の良い尺度にはなりません。

0:57:20.500,0:57:27.840
フランク・ハレルという人がいますが、私は彼の本を読みました。本当に大切な学習の一部です。

0:57:27.840,0:57:31.590
彼は生物統計学の教授で、このことについて多くの素晴らしい記事を書いています。

0:57:33.370,0:57:34.810
彼は

0:57:34.810,0:57:39.029
帰無仮説検定とp値が科学に大きな害を与えていると言っています。

0:57:39.700,0:57:44.520
彼は「帰無仮説有意性検定は全く機能しなかった」という別の記事も書いています。

0:57:45.550,0:57:47.230
という事で、

0:57:47.230,0:57:48.730
私はp値が何であるかを示したのは、

0:57:48.730,0:57:56.070
なぜ機能しないのかを知るためであって、それを使えるようにするためではありません。しかし、それらは機械学習の超重要な部分で、

0:57:57.010,0:58:03.570
それはいつも出てきます。「この薬が効くのかどうか」とか、

0:58:04.270,0:58:06.630
「疫学的な関係があるかどうか」などと、

0:58:07.330,0:58:11.580
判断するために度々取り上げられます。

0:58:12.220,0:58:14.220
そしてこの論文にもp値が出てきます。

0:58:14.710,0:58:18.149
この論文では、多重線形回帰の結果が

0:58:19.030,0:58:21.030
示されています。

0:58:21.310,0:58:24.840
彼らは、p値が0.01以下の関係の隣に

0:58:25.480,0:58:29.070
3つの星をつけています。

0:58:30.880,0:58:32.880
さて、

0:58:34.420,0:58:39.240
0.01以下のような小さなp値については、何か役に立つことがあります。

0:58:40.150,0:58:43.890
それは、私たちが見ているものは、おそらく偶然起こったのでないという事です。

0:58:44.440,0:58:46.390
人々がいつも犯している

0:58:46.390,0:58:52.259
最大の統計的ミスは、p値が0.05以下ではないことを見て

0:58:52.660,0:58:55.080
関係が存在しないという誤った結論を

0:58:55.660,0:59:00.120
下してしまうことです

0:59:01.060,0:59:05.399
それは意味不明です。なぜなら、3つのデータポイントしかなかったとすると、

0:59:06.039,0:59:11.999
どの仮説に対してもp値が0.05未満になるような十分なデータはほぼ確実に得られないからです。

0:59:13.299,0:59:19.619
そこで、確認する方法としては、戻って、「もし私が全く逆の帰無仮説を選んだとしたらどうだろうか？」と考えるのです。

0:59:20.140,0:59:24.210
もし私の帰無仮説が、「温度とRの間に関係がある」だったとしたらどうでしょうか？

0:59:24.789,0:59:27.059
その帰無仮説を棄却するのに十分なデータがあるでしょうか？

0:59:28.029,0:59:32.129
答えがノーなら、

0:59:32.950,0:59:34.359
それは

0:59:34.359,0:59:38.338
どの結論を出すのにも十分なデータがないだけですよね？

0:59:38.890,0:59:45.569
この場合、彼らは温度とRの間に関係があると確信するのに

0:59:46.329,0:59:48.329
十分なデータを持っています。

0:59:48.490,0:59:49.779
これは変です。

0:59:49.779,0:59:54.989
なぜならたった先ほど、グラフを見て、エクセルで手早く計算して、これは、

0:59:55.509,0:59:58.019
ランダムかもしれないという結論に至ったからです。

1:00:00.039,1:00:02.039
問題はここにあります。

1:00:02.619,1:00:08.518
このグラフは、一変量関係と呼ばれるものを示しています。一変量関係は、

1:00:08.890,1:00:13.319
1つの独立変数と1つの従属変数の間の関係を示します。それが普通のグラフに表示できるものです。

1:00:14.019,1:00:16.169
しかし、このケースでは、

1:00:16.990,1:00:19.259
多変量モデルを用いて、気温、

1:00:20.259,1:00:21.609
湿度、

1:00:21.609,1:00:23.559
一人当たりGDP、

1:00:23.559,1:00:25.559
人口密度を調べました。

1:00:25.599,1:00:33.179
そして、それらをすべてモデルに入れると、温度と湿度について統計的に有意な結果が得られることになります。

1:00:33.730,1:00:37.079
なぜそうなるのでしょうか？なぜこのようなことが起こるのかというと、

1:00:38.950,1:00:43.169
青い点のこれらのすべての変化は無作為ではないのです。

1:00:43.420,1:00:47.159
異なっているのには理由がありますよね？その理由としては、

1:00:48.069,1:00:51.538
例えば、密度の高い都市ほど透過率が高いでしょう。

1:00:52.150,1:00:57.180
湿度の高い都市ほど透過率は低くなります。

1:00:59.109,1:01:06.689
多変量モデルを使うと結果に自信が持てるようになります。

1:01:09.309,1:01:16.169
しかし、アメリカ統計協会が指摘しているように、p値は、これが実際に重要かどうかを教えてくれるものではありません。

1:01:17.109,1:01:21.119
これが実用的に重要かどうかを教えてくれるのは、グラフの傾きです。

1:01:21.910,1:01:23.940
この場合、

1:01:25.930,1:01:33.719
彼らが出してきた方程式は R = 3.968から0.0383かける温度を引き、

1:01:33.720,1:01:38.130
それから0.0224かける相対湿度を引いたものです。

1:01:38.170,1:01:44.909
これはこの方程式です。これは実用的に重要でしょうか？ ここでまた、手早く

1:01:47.710,1:01:49.710
エクセルに入力してみましょう。

1:01:50.800,1:01:58.680
温度が10℃で湿度が40％の場所があったとします。

1:01:58.680,1:02:00.960
この式が正しいとすると Rは約2.7になります。 

1:02:01.840,1:02:05.340
温度が35℃で湿度が80％の場所では

1:02:06.070,1:02:08.070
約0.8になります。

1:02:08.380,1:02:12.630
これは実質的に重要でしょうか？何てことでしょう、そうです。

1:02:13.360,1:02:16.259
異なる気候を持つ２つの異なる都市は、

1:02:16.960,1:02:20.369
もし他のすべての点で同じであって、このモデルが正しければ、

1:02:21.010,1:02:28.290
１つの都市では病気が広がらず（Rが1より小さいので）、１つの都市では大規模な指数関数的爆発が起こるでしょう。

1:02:29.650,1:02:31.000
ですから、

1:02:31.000,1:02:38.400
もしこのモデルが正しければ、これは非常に実用的に重要な結果であることがわかります。

1:02:38.400,1:02:43.799
このように、モデルの実用的な重要性を判断する方法は、p値ではなく、

1:02:44.380,1:02:47.579
実際の結果を見て判断することです。

1:02:48.910,1:02:51.180
ですから、モデルの実用的な重要性を

1:02:52.360,1:02:54.539
どのように考え、

1:02:55.150,1:03:00.420
予測モデルをどのようにして生産に役立つものに変えていけばいいのでしょう。

1:03:01.000,1:03:05.880
私はこのことについて何年も考えてきました。

1:03:06.490,1:03:08.230
そして

1:03:08.230,1:03:11.190
実際に他の素晴らしい人たちと一緒に論文を作成しました。

1:03:13.330,1:03:15.330
「優れたデータ製品の設計」

1:03:17.320,1:03:19.180
これは

1:03:19.180,1:03:21.180
私が設立した

1:03:22.270,1:03:24.840
オプティマル・ディシジョン・グループという会社で

1:03:24.840,1:03:28.920
10年に渡って行ってきた仕事に基づいています。オプティマル・ディシジョンズ・グループは

1:03:29.230,1:03:33.849
保険会社がどのような価格を設定すべきかを把握することに重点を置いていました。

1:03:34.520,1:03:35.960
それまで

1:03:35.960,1:03:41.919
保険会社は、予測モデリングに重点を置いていました。特にアクチュアリーは、

1:03:42.619,1:03:44.619
Spent their time trying to figure out

1:03:46.190,1:03:50.649
車を衝突させる可能性がどの程度あるのか、また衝突した場合の損害はどの程度なのかを把握し、

1:03:51.440,1:03:55.779
それに基づいて保険会社がどのような価格を設定すべきかを考えることに時間を費やしていました。

1:03:56.809,1:04:01.449
この会社の場合は、別のアプローチ、

1:04:01.700,1:04:08.359
つまりここで説明したドライブトレインアプローチというものを使って、

1:04:08.359,1:04:13.749
保険の価格を設定だけではなく他にもいろいろなことに活用してきました。保険の例で言うと、

1:04:14.720,1:04:17.709
保険会社の目的は、いかにして

1:04:18.559,1:04:20.559
5年間の利益を

1:04:21.049,1:04:23.049
最大化するかということです。

1:04:23.539,1:04:28.419
そのために、どのようなインプットをコントロールすることができるでしょか。私はこれをレバーと呼びます。

1:04:29.029,1:04:32.229
この場合、それは設定する価格です。

1:04:32.779,1:04:39.339
そして、データは、レバーを変えることで目的がどう変わるかを知ることのできるデータです。

1:04:39.470,1:04:46.299
例えば、車を衝突させる可能性の高い人たちの価格を上げれば、そういう人たちの数は減り、

1:04:46.299,1:04:52.059
コストは減りますが、同時に収入も減ることになります。

1:04:52.609,1:05:00.369
そこで、収集したデータを介して、目的とレバーを結びつけるために、レバーがどのように目的に影響を与えるかを説明する

1:05:01.160,1:05:03.160
モデルを構築しました。

1:05:03.740,1:05:08.469
このように言うと、当たり前のことのように思えますが、

1:05:09.200,1:05:16.839
私たちが1999年にオプティマル・ディシジョンズの仕事を始めたときには、保険業界では誰もこのようなことをしていませんでした。

1:05:18.020,1:05:23.709
保険業界では誰もが予測モデルを使って 車を衝突させる可能性を推測していました。 

1:05:24.500,1:05:31.250
そして価格設定は20％とか何かを追加して設定するなど、非常にナイーブな方法で行われていました。

1:05:31.250,1:05:32.559
私がしたことは、

1:05:32.559,1:05:39.339
この基本的なプロセスを何年にもわたって、多くの企業が予測モデルを行動に移すために、このプロセスをどのように使うかを理解する

1:05:40.010,1:05:42.010
手助けをしてきたことです。

1:05:43.160,1:05:45.160
特定のモデルで

1:05:45.170,1:05:51.300
実際に価値を得るための出発点は、自分が何をしようとしているのかを考えることであり、

1:05:51.300,1:05:53.519
自分がしようとしていることの価値の源泉は何かを知ることです。

1:05:54.190,1:06:00.810
レバーとは、私たちが何を変えることができるのか？何もできないのであれば、予測モデルの意味はないでしょう。

1:06:02.170,1:06:06.270
自分が持っていないデータを見つける方法や、適切なデータ、利用可能なデータを見つけ出し、

1:06:06.460,1:06:09.480
その上でどのようなアプローチでアナリティクスに取り組むかを考えます。

1:06:10.180,1:06:13.750
そして超重要なのは、

1:06:13.750,1:06:18.869
その変更を実際に実行できるかどうかです。そして、環境の変化に合わせて

1:06:18.910,1:06:22.500
実際にどのように変化させていくかということも非常に重要です。

1:06:22.750,1:06:29.489
興味深いことに、これらのことの多くは、学術的な研究があまり行われていない分野です。少しはありますが。

1:06:31.359,1:06:37.289
「メンテナンス」に関する論文の中には、機械学習モデルがまだ大丈夫かどうかをどうやって判断するのか、

1:06:38.109,1:06:43.919
どうやって更新して行ったらいいのか、などがあります。たくさんの引用がありましたが、

1:06:44.650,1:06:49.889
多くの人が数学に集中しているため、あまり頻繁には出てきませんでした。

1:06:50.859,1:06:55.169
そして、「この全体にはどんな制約があるのか」という全体的な質問があります。

1:06:55.270,1:07:01.259
この本の中には、この６つのことを一つ一つ解説した付録がついています。

1:07:01.599,1:07:05.068
そして、例のリストがあります。

1:07:05.770,1:07:09.540
これは、価値について考える方法の一例です。

1:07:11.050,1:07:18.149
また、企業や組織が実際の生産に向けて、効果的な製品にするために、

1:07:19.960,1:07:22.949
これらの異なるパズルの

1:07:24.190,1:07:30.569
すべての部分について考えてみるために使える質問もたくさんあります。質問があります。はい、ちょっと待ってください。

1:07:30.569,1:07:36.959
だから私が言おうとしていたので、この付録をチェックしてみてください。なぜならこの付録は実は元々ブログ記事として登場したもので、

1:07:37.540,1:07:40.409
私がレイチェルと一緒に書いたcovid-19の記事を除けば、

1:07:40.410,1:07:46.260
実は今まで書いたブログ記事の中で最も人気のあるもので、数十万回の閲覧数を誇ります。そしてそれは、

1:07:47.319,1:07:49.180
20年間の苦労して勝ち取った

1:07:49.180,1:07:53.700
実際にどのように機械学習から価値を得るのか、

1:07:54.190,1:07:59.099
そして実際に何を尋ねなければならないのかという洞察のようなものです。ぜひチェックしてみてください。参考になれば幸いです。

1:07:59.930,1:08:01.930
季節性とcovid-19の伝染性の関係について

1:08:02.870,1:08:10.420
人々はどのように考えるべきか、という質問について考えるときには、

1:08:13.130,1:08:16.840
データの中の数字が何なのかだけでなく、

1:08:18.200,1:08:22.510
実際にはどのように見えるのか、という質問を深く掘り下げる必要があります。

1:08:22.510,1:08:27.369
論文の中で、彼らが示しているものの一つは、実際の地図です。 

1:08:28.040,1:08:29.840
温度と

1:08:29.840,1:08:32.829
湿度とRの地図です。

1:08:33.650,1:08:37.659
驚くことではありませんが、

1:08:38.330,1:08:40.330
中国の湿度と気温は、

1:08:40.520,1:08:46.419
私たちが自動相関と呼んでいるものです。つまり、地理的に近い場所では、

1:08:46.730,1:08:51.490
気温も湿度も似ています。

1:08:51.530,1:08:53.270
このように、

1:08:53.270,1:08:57.520
彼らが示したp値に疑惑が出てきます。

1:08:58.160,1:09:03.519
なぜなら、これらの都市を100個の全く別の都市とは考えられないからです。

1:09:03.920,1:09:07.420
互いに近接している都市は、おそらく非常に似たような傾向が見られ、

1:09:07.420,1:09:10.180
これらを少数の「都市の集合体」のようなものと

1:09:10.940,1:09:16.370
考えるべきかもしれません。大地域のような。

1:09:16.370,1:09:21.700
このように実際にモデルを検討する際には、何が限界なのかを考える必要があります。 

1:09:22.310,1:09:27.700
そして、それが何を意味するのか？それについてどうすればいいのか？

1:09:29.720,1:09:36.340
このようなユーティリティ（実用性）の観点から考える必要があります。

1:09:37.070,1:09:40.299
最初から最後まで、私にできる行動は何か、それによってどんな結果になるのか。

1:09:41.210,1:09:44.500
ただの帰無仮説検定ではありません。このケースでは、

1:09:46.520,1:09:48.760
基本的にここでは4つの主な結果が考えられます。

1:09:49.430,1:09:58.630
一つ目の可能性は「温度とRの間には実際に関係がある」です。

1:09:59.720,1:10:05.050
それはこの右側です。あるいは、温度とRの間には実際には関係がないということです。

1:10:06.350,1:10:09.610
そして、関係があると仮定して行動するかもしれません。

1:10:10.100,1:10:15.220
あるいは、関係がないと仮定して行動するかもしれません。

1:10:16.040,1:10:18.040
だから、４つの可能性をそれぞれ見て、

1:10:19.250,1:10:21.250
経済的、社会的な結果はどうなるのかと考える必要があります。　

1:10:22.070,1:10:25.329
それぞれ大きな違いがあります。

1:10:26.000,1:10:30.220
失われた命の数や、経済の崩壊、その他何でもあります。

1:10:30.980,1:10:32.980
その四つの一つ一つに。

1:10:34.760,1:10:40.420
この論文の中には、もし彼らのモデルが正しければ、

1:10:40.550,1:10:48.219
3月の世界の全ての都市のR値はどうなるかを示しています。そして、世界の全ての都市の7月のR値はどうなるか。

1:10:48.950,1:10:53.800
例えば、ニューイングランドやニューヨークを見てみましょう。 

1:10:54.530,1:11:00.009
この予測では、西海岸の海岸線も含めて、7月には

1:11:01.640,1:11:03.640
病気が広がらなくなると予測されています。

1:11:03.800,1:11:07.090
もしそうなったら、もし彼らの予測が正しければ、

1:11:07.880,1:11:13.089
それは大惨事になります。なぜならアメリカやイギリスでは、

1:11:13.790,1:11:16.790
「ああ、この病気は問題ではないことがわかった」と言われる可能性が高いと思います。

1:11:16.980,1:11:21.669
「実際には全く流行しなかった」とか「科学者は間違っていた」などと。

1:11:22.160,1:11:25.240
人々は以前の日常生活に戻ります。

1:11:25.820,1:11:32.679
1918年に起こったように,冬時期のインフルエンザウイルスの第2波は

1:11:33.740,1:11:35.740
最初よりもずっと悪い状態に

1:11:36.200,1:11:41.260
なりました。これが真か偽かによって、

1:11:42.320,1:11:48.489
政策に大きな影響を与える可能性があります。考えてみましょう。 

1:11:49.280,1:11:55.179
はい？私が言いたかったのは、「夏になれば解決する」と考えるのは非常に無責任だということです。

1:11:55.730,1:11:57.999
「今すぐに行動する必要はない」と。

1:11:58.760,1:12:05.800
これは指数関数的に成長しているものであり、膨大な被害をもたらす可能性があるということだけです。被害はすでに起きているのですが。

1:12:06.650,1:12:07.450
どっちにしても問題です。

1:12:07.450,1:12:11.530
もし季節性があると仮定して、夏が解決すると仮定したら、

1:12:11.990,1:12:17.949
今は無関心になるかもしれません。逆にもし季節性がないと仮定したものの、

1:12:18.650,1:12:23.949
季節性があった場合、滅亡への予想が実際に起こるよりも大きくなり、

1:12:25.210,1:12:30.449
国民がさらに無関心になることになるかもしれない

1:12:30.449,1:12:34.559
どの方向に間違っても問題になります。 

1:12:35.350,1:12:40.409
ですから、この種のモデリングを行う際の対処法の1つは、prior(事前)について考えてみることです。

1:12:41.230,1:12:45.750￥
prior(事前)とは、基本的には、帰無仮説を持つのではなく、

1:12:46.150,1:12:52.230
何がより可能性が高いのかを推測することです。 この場合、

1:12:54.070,1:13:00.420
記憶が正しければ、インフルエンザウイルスが27℃で不活性化することがわかっています。

1:13:00.730,1:13:03.209
そして風邪のコロナウイルスは

1:13:04.120,1:13:09.509
季節性があることがわかっています。1918年のインフルエンザの

1:13:10.449,1:13:12.250
大流行は季節性でした。

1:13:12.250,1:13:17.909
これまでに研究された全ての国や都市で

1:13:17.909,1:13:21.059
今のところほとんどは常に気候との関係を発見しています。 

1:13:21.159,1:13:25.469
だから私たちの事前の推測は多分これは季節的なもので、
so maybe we'd say well prior belief is that this thing is probably

1:13:25.780,1:13:29.190
そしてこの論文は、それにいくつかの

1:13:30.010,1:13:32.010
証拠を加えているということになるでしょう。

1:13:32.230,1:13:34.230
このように、

1:13:34.300,1:13:38.250
モデルを実際に使用して、

1:13:39.340,1:13:46.560
この場合の政策議論だけでなく、組織的判断などに使用することがいかに複雑であるかわかると思います。

1:13:47.230,1:13:49.230
なぜなら、ご存じのように、

1:13:49.719,1:13:53.759
常に複雑さや不確実性があるからです。だから、実際には

1:13:54.429,1:13:59.729
ユーティリティと自分の最善の推測を考えて、できる限りすべてを組み合わせるようにしなければなりません。

1:14:00.400,1:14:05.250
そう言ったところで

1:14:07.659,1:14:08.890
それでもやっぱり

1:14:08.890,1:14:10.890
モデルを

1:14:11.590,1:14:16.350
稼働させることができたらいいなと思います。ただ予測モデルであっても、

1:14:17.170,1:14:22.589
それ自体が有用な場合もありますし、何かをプロトタイプ化することが役立つこともあります。 

1:14:23.230,1:14:28.919
時には、何か大きなものの一部になることもあります。だから、ここでは巨大なエンドツーエンドのモデルを作ろうとするのではなく、

1:14:28.920,1:14:30.920
私たちは、どのようにして

1:14:31.780,1:14:33.780
Pytorchと

1:14:35.020,1:14:37.020
FastAIのモデルを

1:14:37.570,1:14:39.000
稼働させるかを説明することにしました。

1:14:39.000,1:14:45.180
可能な限り生の状態で。そこから、あなたの好きなように、その上に構築することができます。

1:14:45.610,1:14:47.610
そのためには、

1:14:47.710,1:14:49.510
自分のデータセットを

1:14:49.510,1:14:53.699
ダウンロードし、キュレーションする必要があります。そして、あなたも同じことをします。

1:14:54.340,1:14:58.139
そのデータセットを使って自分のモデルを学習し、

1:14:58.960,1:15:02.340
アプリケーションを作成して、それを公開するのです。

1:15:03.100,1:15:05.020
さて，

1:15:05.020,1:15:10.169
画像データセットを作成する方法はたくさんあります。自分のパソコンに写真があるかもしれませんし

1:15:11.110,1:15:13.110
職場であるものを使うかもしれません。

1:15:15.160,1:15:20.789
しかし、最も簡単な方法は、インターネットから画像をダウンロードすることです。 インターネットからダウンロードできるサービスはたくさんあります。

1:15:21.640,1:15:26.459
ここではBing Image Searchを使います。とても使いやすいからです。　

1:15:27.010,1:15:33.119
他の多くのサービスはサイトの利用規約違反を犯す必要があります。

1:15:33.610,1:15:36.869
そのため、ここではその方法をお見せしません。

1:15:37.420,1:15:40.410
しかし、その方法を示す例はたくさんあります。

1:15:40.870,1:15:43.140
だから、どうしても知りたかったら、あなたはそれらを調べることができます。

1:15:43.690,1:15:47.850
Bingの画像検索は、今のところとても良いです。こういったものは頻繁に変わり、

1:15:47.850,1:15:50.430
おすすめが変わることもあるので、

1:15:51.460,1:15:53.460
ウェブサイトで確認してみてください。

1:15:53.710,1:16:00.000
Bing Image Searchの最大の問題点は、登録手続きが悪夢のようだということです。

1:16:00.730,1:16:06.390
今のところは。この本の最も難しい部分の1つは、彼らのAPIにサインアップすることのような気がします。

1:16:07.240,1:16:11.610
それにはAzureを経由する必要があります。それは Azure Cognitive Services と呼ばれていて

1:16:11.710,1:16:17.220
だから、私たちは、サインアップする方法がわかるように、すべての情報がウェブサイト上にあることを確認しておきます。

1:16:17.830,1:16:19.830
ということで、すでにサインアップされているという前提で

1:16:20.410,1:16:22.410
話を進めていきます。

1:16:25.060,1:16:27.060
Bing Image Search APIで検索

1:16:28.510,1:16:36.090
今のところ、7日間あまり制限なく

1:16:38.140,1:16:41.010
無料で利用できます。その後も

1:16:42.430,1:16:44.430
利用できますが、

1:16:44.650,1:16:46.650
as long as you like

1:16:46.750,1:16:53.709
But they kind of limit it to like three transactions per second or something, which is plenty you can still do thousands for free

1:16:53.710,1:16:56.530
So it's at the moment. It's pretty great. Even for free

1:16:58.460,1:16:59.480
So

1:16:59.480,1:17:01.250
What will happen is?

1:17:01.250,1:17:06.220
When you sign up for being image search or any of these kind of services, they'll give you an API key

1:17:06.290,1:17:11.649
So just replace the xxx here with the API key that they give you

1:17:11.750,1:17:14.740
Okay, so that's now going to be called key

1:17:16.070,1:17:18.070
In fact, let's do it over here

1:17:20.060,1:17:24.399
Okay, so you'll put in your key and then there's a

1:17:25.400,1:17:29.530
function we've created called search images Bing, which is just a super tiny little

1:17:31.520,1:17:35.200
Function as you can see, it's just two lines of code. Just trying to save a little bit of time

1:17:37.340,1:17:39.340
Which will take some

1:17:39.470,1:17:44.919
Take your API key and some search term and return a list of URLs that match that search term

1:17:46.160,1:17:48.160
as you can see for

1:17:48.830,1:17:50.510
using

1:17:50.510,1:17:54.609
This particular service. You have to install a particular

1:17:55.730,1:17:59.530
Package, so we show you how to do that on the site as well

1:18:00.380,1:18:02.620
so once you've done so you'll be able to run this and

1:18:03.740,1:18:06.909
That will return by default. I think 150

1:18:07.610,1:18:09.050
URLs

1:18:09.050,1:18:12.969
Okay, so faster Y comes with a download URL function

1:18:12.970,1:18:17.439
So he let's just download one of those images just to check and open it up

1:18:17.440,1:18:22.240
And so what I did was I searched for grizzly bear and here I have a grizzly bear

1:18:24.110,1:18:26.230
So then what I did was I said, okay

1:18:26.230,1:18:32.589
Let's try and create a create a model that can recognize grizzly bears versus black bears versus teddy bears

1:18:33.590,1:18:36.520
So that way I can find out I could set up some video

1:18:38.270,1:18:41.919
Recognition system near our campsite when we're out camping that

1:18:42.530,1:18:43.960
Gives me bear warnings

1:18:43.960,1:18:48.520
But if it's a teddy bear coming then it doesn't warn me and wake me up because that would not be scary at all

1:18:49.460,1:18:52.450
So then I just go through each of those three bear types

1:18:53.030,1:18:54.890
Create a directory

1:18:54.890,1:19:00.669
With the name of grizzly or black or teddy bear searched being for that particular search term

1:19:03.110,1:19:05.000
Along with bear

1:19:05.000,1:19:09.370
And download and so download images is a first day I function as well

1:19:10.430,1:19:13.360
So after that I can call get image files

1:19:13.460,1:19:18.610
Which is a faster a function that will just return recursively all of the image files

1:19:19.040,1:19:24.640
Inside this path and you can see it's given me bears black and then lots of numbers

1:19:27.260,1:19:28.790
So

1:19:28.790,1:19:33.490
one of the things you have to be careful of is that a lot of the stuff you download will turn out to be like

1:19:33.490,1:19:37.990
not images at all and will break so you can call verify images to

1:19:38.450,1:19:41.559
Check that all of these file names are actual images

1:19:42.800,1:19:50.559
And in this case, I didn't have any failed. So there's it's empty. But if you did have some then you would call

1:19:51.920,1:19:58.149
path unlink unlink path to unlink is part of the Python standard library and it deletes a file and

1:19:59.240,1:20:02.169
Map is something that will call this function

1:20:02.990,1:20:06.189
for every element of this collection

1:20:06.830,1:20:08.830
this is part of a

1:20:08.870,1:20:10.730
special

1:20:10.730,1:20:13.450
FASTA a class called L. It's basically

1:20:14.180,1:20:16.570
It's kind of a mix between the Python standard library

1:20:17.330,1:20:23.169
List class and a numpy array class then we'll be learning more about it later in this course

1:20:23.600,1:20:29.769
But it basically tries to make it super easy to do kind of more functional style programming in Python

1:20:30.830,1:20:34.809
So in this case, it's going to unlink every thing that's in the failed

1:20:35.420,1:20:37.420
List, which is probably what we want

1:20:37.880,1:20:42.550
Now because there are all the images that fail to verify. Alright, so we've now got

1:20:43.550,1:20:49.570
a path that contains a whole bunch of images and they're classified according to

1:20:50.510,1:20:54.070
black grizzly or Teddy based on what folder they're in and

1:20:54.680,1:21:01.840
So to create so we're going to create a model and so to create a model. The first thing we need to do is to

1:21:02.360,1:21:04.280
Tell fast AI

1:21:04.280,1:21:07.419
What kind of data we have and how its structured?

1:21:08.690,1:21:15.550
Now in part in lesson 1 of the course, we did that by using what we call a factory method

1:21:15.620,1:21:22.359
Which is we just said image data loader start from name and it did it all for us

1:21:23.869,1:21:26.289
Those factory methods are fine for

1:21:27.020,1:21:30.159
Beginners, but now we're into lesson two. We're not quite beginners anymore

1:21:30.170,1:21:35.799
So we're going to show you the super super flexible way to use data in whatever format you like

1:21:35.960,1:21:40.119
And it's called the data block API. And so the data block API

1:21:45.050,1:21:47.800
Looks like this here's the data block API

1:21:49.340,1:21:55.600
You tell first AI what your independent variable is and what your dependent variable is

1:21:55.600,1:22:02.019
So what your labels are and what your input data is. So in this case our input data are images

1:22:03.170,1:22:08.619
And our labels are categories. So category is going to be either grizzly or black

1:22:09.260,1:22:11.179
or teddy

1:22:11.179,1:22:13.239
So that's the first thing you tell it now

1:22:13.239,1:22:19.178
That's the block's parameter and then you tell it how do you get a list of all of the in this case file names?

1:22:19.520,1:22:24.759
Right, and we just saw how to do that because Peters called the function ourselves if the function is called get image files

1:22:24.889,1:22:28.149
so we tell it what function to use to get that list of items and

1:22:29.090,1:22:34.989
Then you tell it how do you split the data into a validation set and a training set?

1:22:34.989,1:22:39.968
And so we're going to use something called a random spitter which just spits it randomly and we're going to point

1:22:40.130,1:22:42.130
30% of it into the validation set

1:22:42.469,1:22:48.669
we're also going to set the random seed which ensures that every time we run this the validation set will be the same and

1:22:49.760,1:22:55.389
Then you say okay. How do you label the data? And this is the name of a function called parent label?

1:22:55.389,1:22:57.789
And so that's going to look for each

1:22:59.300,1:23:05.560
Item at the name of the parent so this this particular one would become a black bear now

1:23:05.560,1:23:07.560
This is like the most common way for

1:23:09.469,1:23:16.178
Image datasets to be represented is that they get put the different images get the files get put into folder according to their label

1:23:17.119,1:23:18.679
and

1:23:18.679,1:23:21.579
Then finally here we've got something called item transforms

1:23:21.920,1:23:25.359
we're be learning a lot more about transforms in a moment that these are basically

1:23:25.580,1:23:33.070
functions that get applied to each image and so each image is going to be resized to 100 and twenty-eight by

1:23:33.560,1:23:35.560
128 square

1:23:35.960,1:23:38.950
So we're going to be learning more about datablock api soon

1:23:39.200,1:23:44.619
but basically the process is going to be it's going to call whatever is get items which is a list of image files and

1:23:45.650,1:23:50.320
Then I'm going to call get X get Y. So in this case, there's no get X but there is a get Y

1:23:50.320,1:23:55.659
So it's just parent label and then it's going to call the create method for each of these two things

1:23:55.660,1:23:57.789
It's going to create an image and it's going to create a category

1:23:58.520,1:24:01.990
Instead. I'm going to call the item transforms, which is resize

1:24:02.930,1:24:06.249
And then the next thing it does is it puts it into something called a data loader?

1:24:06.250,1:24:10.030
A data loader is something that grabs a few images at a time?

1:24:10.400,1:24:14.890
I think by default at 64 and puts them all into a single

1:24:14.890,1:24:19.090
It's got a batch. It just grabs 64 images and sticks them all together

1:24:19.760,1:24:23.499
And the reason it does that is it then puts them all onto the GPU at once

1:24:24.380,1:24:26.920
so it can pass them all to the

1:24:27.230,1:24:33.640
Model through the GPU in one go and that's going to let the GPU go much faster as we'll be learning about

1:24:34.730,1:24:36.879
And then finally, we don't use any here

1:24:37.190,1:24:43.960
We can have something called batch transforms, which we will talk about later and then somewhere in the mineral about here

1:24:44.480,1:24:51.250
Conceptually is the splitter which is the thing that splits into the training set and the validation set

1:24:51.410,1:24:55.209
So this is a super flexible way to tell fast AI

1:24:56.510,1:25:00.489
how to work with your data and so at the end of that

1:25:01.280,1:25:08.199
It returns an object of type data loaders. That's why we always call these things deals, right?

1:25:08.390,1:25:12.579
So data loaders has a validation and a training

1:25:12.860,1:25:14.150
data loader and

1:25:14.150,1:25:20.470
a data loader as I just mentioned is something that grabs a batch of a few items at a time and puts it on the

1:25:20.470,1:25:22.250
GPU for you

1:25:22.250,1:25:26.530
So this is basically the entire code of data loaders

1:25:27.470,1:25:31.269
So the details don't matter. I just wanted to point out that like a lot of these

1:25:31.850,1:25:34.629
Concepts in fast AI when you actually look at what they are

1:25:34.630,1:25:36.460
They're they're incredibly simple

1:25:36.460,1:25:42.100
but all things it's literally something that you just pass in a few data loaders to edit store some in an attribute and

1:25:42.410,1:25:47.359
Pass and gives you the first one backers train and second one backers valid

1:25:49.199,1:25:51.090
So

1:25:51.090,1:25:53.210
we can create our

1:25:55.230,1:26:02.359
Data loaders by first of all creating the data block and then we call the data loaders passing in our path to create deals and

1:26:02.940,1:26:05.029
Then you can call show batch on that

1:26:05.030,1:26:10.280
You can call show bachelor pretty much anything in fast AI to see your data and look we've got some Grizzlies

1:26:10.280,1:26:12.280
We've got a teddy we've got a grizzly

1:26:14.280,1:26:16.280
So you get the idea right

1:26:17.880,1:26:22.699
I'm going to look at these different. I'm going to look at data augmentation next week

1:26:22.699,1:26:27.469
So I'm going to skip over data-orientation and let's just jump straight into trading your model

1:26:31.710,1:26:35.089
So once we've got two yells we can just like in

1:26:35.760,1:26:39.199
Lesson one call CNN learner to create a

1:26:39.719,1:26:43.038
Resonate we're going to create a smaller resonant this time or isn't it 18?

1:26:43.590,1:26:49.519
Again asking for error rate we can then call dot fine-tune again. So you see it's all the same lines of code

1:26:49.519,1:26:50.999
we've already seen and

1:26:50.999,1:26:55.819
You can see our error rate goes down from nine to one. So we've got one percent error

1:26:56.519,1:27:02.719
And after training for about 25 seconds, so you can see you know, we've only got 450 images

1:27:03.690,1:27:10.789
we've trained for well less than a minute and we only have let's look at the confusion matrix so we can say I

1:27:11.400,1:27:18.559
Want to create a classification interpretation class. I want to look at the confusion matrix and the confusion matrix as you can see

1:27:18.659,1:27:21.768
It's something that says for things that are actually black bears

1:27:22.650,1:27:24.769
How many are predicted to be black bears?

1:27:25.559,1:27:26.610
versus

1:27:26.610,1:27:28.610
grizzly bears versus

1:27:28.679,1:27:33.859
Teddy bears. So the diagonal are the ones that are all correct. And so it looks like we've got two errors

1:27:33.860,1:27:38.150
We've got one grizzly that was predicted be black one black that was predictable grizzly

1:27:40.889,1:27:42.889
Super super useful

1:27:43.469,1:27:47.239
Method is plot top losses, and that'll actually show me

1:27:48.809,1:27:56.119
What my errors actually look like so this one here was predicted to be a grizzly bear but the label was black bear

1:27:56.770,1:28:00.450
This one was the one that's predictably a black bear and the label was grizzly bear

1:28:02.500,1:28:04.800
These ones here are not actually wrong there

1:28:04.830,1:28:11.160
this is predicted to be black and it's actually black but the reason they appear in this is because these are the ones that the

1:28:12.730,1:28:15.540
Model was the least confident about

1:28:16.780,1:28:19.829
Okay, so we're going to look at the image classifier cleaner next week

1:28:20.800,1:28:23.789
Let's focus on how we then get this into production

1:28:24.700,1:28:25.930
so

1:28:25.930,1:28:27.930
To get it into production

1:28:28.150,1:28:30.150
We need to

1:28:30.580,1:28:38.519
Export the model. So what exporting the model does is it creates a new file which by default is called export pickle?

1:28:39.280,1:28:41.170
Which contains?

1:28:41.170,1:28:43.920
The architecture and all of the parameters of the model

1:28:44.170,1:28:50.160
so that is now something that you can copy over to a server somewhere and

1:28:50.710,1:28:52.710
treat it as a

1:28:52.900,1:29:00.030
Predefined program right? So then so the the process of using your trained model

1:29:01.150,1:29:04.920
On new data kind of in production is called inference

1:29:05.410,1:29:10.019
So here I've created an inference learner by loading that learner back again

1:29:10.390,1:29:17.640
All right, and so obviously it doesn't make sense to do it right next to after I've saved it in a notebook

1:29:17.640,1:29:23.459
But I'm just showing you how it work. Right? So this is something that you would do on your server in inference and

1:29:24.730,1:29:31.470
Remember that once you have trained a model, you can just treat it as a program you can pass inputs to it

1:29:31.470,1:29:33.990
So this is now our our program

1:29:33.990,1:29:40.590
this is our Bayer predictor so I can now call predict on it and I can pass it an image and

1:29:41.200,1:29:43.200
It will tell me

1:29:43.210,1:29:45.210
Here is it is?

1:29:45.490,1:29:47.999
99.999% sure that this is a grizzly

1:29:49.240,1:29:53.280
So I think what we're going to do here is we're going to wrap it up here

1:29:54.160,1:29:57.180
And next week we'll finish off by

1:29:58.750,1:30:00.750
Creating an actual GUI

1:30:01.180,1:30:02.680
for our

1:30:02.680,1:30:04.510
bear classifier

1:30:04.510,1:30:06.370
We will

1:30:06.370,1:30:08.140
show how to

1:30:08.140,1:30:10.140
Run it for free on a service call

1:30:10.920,1:30:12.570
binder

1:30:12.570,1:30:14.570
and

1:30:16.530,1:30:23.150
Yeah, and then I think we'll be ready to dive into some of the some of the details of what's going on behind the scenes

1:30:23.849,1:30:27.379
Um any questions or anything else before we wrap up Rachel?

1:30:28.860,1:30:34.339
Now, okay, great. All right. Thanks everybody. So we

1:30:37.409,1:30:39.679
Hopefully, yeah, I think from here on

1:30:40.830,1:30:42.179
We've covered

1:30:42.179,1:30:49.279
You know, most of the key kind of underlying foundational stuff from a machine-learning point of view that we're going to need to cover

1:30:51.000,1:30:53.060
So we'll be able to ready to dive into

1:30:54.840,1:30:58.310
Lower-level details of how deep learning works behind the scenes

1:31:00.540,1:31:03.889
And I think that'll be starting from next week, so see you then
