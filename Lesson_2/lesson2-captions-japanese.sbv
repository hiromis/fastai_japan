0:00:00.520,0:00:04.020
So, uh, hello everybody and welcome back to

0:00:04.690,0:00:07.319
Practical deep learning for coders. This is lesson two

0:00:08.260,0:00:10.000
and

0:00:10.000,0:00:12.599
and in the last lesson we

0:00:13.570,0:00:19.500
Started training our first models. We didn't really have any idea how that training was really working

0:00:19.500,0:00:22.439
But we were looking at a high-level at what was going on

0:00:23.109,0:00:24.519
and

0:00:24.519,0:00:26.519
We learned about

0:00:26.560,0:00:28.240
what is

0:00:28.240,0:00:30.510
Machine learning and how does that work?

0:00:31.390,0:00:33.390
and

0:00:34.180,0:00:35.860
We

0:00:35.860,0:00:37.420
realized that

0:00:37.420,0:00:43.260
Based on how machine learning worked that there are some fundamental limitations on on what it can do

0:00:43.719,0:00:46.259
And we've talked about some of those limitations now

0:00:46.260,0:00:50.820
We also talked about how after you've trained a machine learning model you end up with a program

0:00:51.309,0:00:56.249
which behaves much like a normal program or something with the inputs and a thing in the middle and

0:00:56.829,0:00:58.449
outputs

0:00:58.449,0:01:00.449
so today we're gonna

0:01:00.850,0:01:02.850
finish up talking about

0:01:03.280,0:01:05.820
Talking about that and we're going to then look at how we get those

0:01:06.400,0:01:09.119
Models into production and what some of the issues with doing that?

0:01:10.000,0:01:12.000
might be I

0:01:12.939,0:01:14.939
Wanted to remind you that there are

0:01:15.369,0:01:19.438
Two sets of books. I sorry two sets of notebooks available to you

0:01:20.590,0:01:23.100
One is the the the fast book

0:01:24.009,0:01:29.249
Repo the full actual notebooks containing all the text of the O'Reilly book

0:01:30.220,0:01:32.939
and so this lets you see

0:01:33.460,0:01:35.939
Everything that I'm telling you in much more detail

0:01:36.430,0:01:43.319
And then as well as that there's the course v4 repo which contains exactly the same notebooks

0:01:43.320,0:01:46.680
But with all the pros stripped away to help you study

0:01:47.140,0:01:52.439
so that's where you really want to be doing your experiment and your practice and so maybe as you

0:01:52.780,0:01:58.949
Listen to the video. You can kind of switch back and forth between the video and reading or do one and then the other

0:01:59.530,0:02:04.320
And then put it away and have a look at the course fee for notebooks and try to remember like okay

0:02:04.320,0:02:09.239
What was this section about and run the code and see what happens and change it and so forth

0:02:11.830,0:02:13.830
So we were looking at

0:02:16.780,0:02:19.860
This line of code where we looked at how we created

0:02:20.800,0:02:22.800
our our data

0:02:23.080,0:02:26.790
by passing in information, perhaps most importantly

0:02:27.370,0:02:31.230
Some way to label the data and we talked about the importance of labeling

0:02:31.230,0:02:35.250
And in this case this particular data set whether it's a cat or a dog

0:02:35.290,0:02:39.059
You can tell by whether it's an uppercase or a lowercase letter in the first

0:02:39.970,0:02:43.139
Position that's just how this data set if they tell you when the readme works

0:02:44.320,0:02:50.699
And we are also looked particularly at this idea of valid percent equals zero point two and like what does that mean?

0:02:50.700,0:02:55.679
It creates a validation set and that was something I wanted to talk more about

0:02:56.740,0:03:00.540
The first thing I do want to do though is point out that this particular

0:03:04.330,0:03:07.320
Labeling function returns something that's either true or false

0:03:09.610,0:03:15.179
And actually this data set as we'll see later also tells also contains the actual breed of

0:03:15.910,0:03:20.429
37 different cat and dog breeds so you can you can also grab that from the filename

0:03:21.910,0:03:29.249
In each of those two cases. We're trying to predict a category. Is it a cat or is it a dog or is it a

0:03:30.190,0:03:34.739
German Shepherd or a beagle or a ragdoll cat or whatever?

0:03:35.440,0:03:42.389
When you're trying to predict a category, so when the label is a category, we call that a classification model

0:03:43.750,0:03:45.519
on the other hand

0:03:45.519,0:03:50.879
You might try to predict. How old is the animal or how tall is it?

0:03:51.640,0:03:52.959
or

0:03:52.959,0:03:58.469
Something like that, which is like a continuous number that could be like 13.2 or 26.5 or whatever

0:03:59.110,0:04:05.729
Anytime you're trying to predict a number your label is a number you call that regression, okay?

0:04:05.730,0:04:07.860
So those are the two main types of model

0:04:08.410,0:04:13.919
Classification and regressions. This is very important. Jargon to know about so the regression model

0:04:14.769,0:04:19.379
Attempts to predict one or more numeric quantities such as temperature or location or whatever

0:04:20.400,0:04:27.229
this is a bit confusing because sometimes people use the word regression as a shortcut to a particular a like a

0:04:27.810,0:04:31.310
abbreviation for a particular kind of model called linear regression

0:04:33.180,0:04:39.139
That's super confusing because that's not what regression means linear regression is just a particular kind of regression

0:04:39.419,0:04:43.189
but I just wanted to warn you of that when you start talking about regression a lot of

0:04:44.580,0:04:48.590
People will assume you're talking about linear regression even though that's not what the word means

0:04:50.790,0:04:57.589
All right, so I wanted to talk about this valid percent zero point two thing, so as we described valid percent

0:04:58.470,0:05:04.850
grabs in this case twenty percent of the data if it's zero point two and puts it aside like in a separate bucket and

0:05:05.220,0:05:07.220
Then when you train your model

0:05:07.650,0:05:10.190
Your model doesn't get to look at that data at all

0:05:10.770,0:05:17.780
That data is only used to decide to show you how accurate your model is

0:05:20.010,0:05:22.010
So if you train for too long

0:05:23.070,0:05:27.229
And or with not enough data and/or a model with too many parameters

0:05:27.599,0:05:33.889
After a while the accuracy of your model will actually get worse and this is called overfitting

0:05:34.349,0:05:38.419
Right. So we use the validation set to ensure that we're not

0:05:38.940,0:05:40.940
overfitting the

0:05:42.000,0:05:45.019
Next line of code that we looked at is this one

0:05:45.750,0:05:51.500
where we created something called a learner we'll be learning a lot more about that that a learner is basically more is

0:05:51.780,0:05:53.780
something which contains your data and

0:05:54.990,0:05:56.130
your

0:05:56.130,0:05:59.630
Architecture that is the mathematical function that you're optimizing

0:06:00.630,0:06:07.699
And so a learner is the thing that tries to figure out what are the parameters which best cause this function?

0:06:07.949,0:06:11.779
To match the labels in this data

0:06:12.449,0:06:14.689
so we're talking a lot more about that, but basically

0:06:15.240,0:06:19.760
This particular function resinate 34 is the name of a particular architecture

0:06:19.979,0:06:23.449
Which is just very good for computer vision problems

0:06:24.030,0:06:24.930
in fact

0:06:24.930,0:06:30.829
The name really is ResNet and then 34 tells you how many layers there are so you can use ones with bigger numbers

0:06:31.080,0:06:38.330
Here to get more parameters that will take to train take more memory more likely to overfit that could also

0:06:39.990,0:06:41.990
Create more complex models

0:06:42.480,0:06:46.759
Right now though. I wanted to focus on this part here, which is metrics equals error rate

0:06:47.580,0:06:54.199
this is where you list the functions that you want to be the that you want to be called with your data with your

0:06:54.330,0:06:56.330
Validation data and print it out

0:06:56.430,0:06:58.430
after each epoch and

0:06:58.770,0:07:00.120
epoch is

0:07:00.120,0:07:04.730
is what we call it when you look at every single image in the data set once and

0:07:05.670,0:07:12.259
so after you've looked at every image in the data set once we print out some information about how you're doing and

0:07:12.450,0:07:17.300
The most important thing we print out is the result of calling these metrics

0:07:17.550,0:07:23.240
so error rate is the name of a metric and it's a function that just prints out what percent of the

0:07:23.520,0:07:26.570
Validation set are being incorrectly classified by your model

0:07:28.920,0:07:34.820
So our metrics a function that measures the quality of the predictions using the validation set

0:07:35.370,0:07:40.370
So error rates one another common metric is accuracy, which is just 1 minus error rate

0:07:41.190,0:07:45.410
So very important to remember from last week. We talked about loss

0:07:46.680,0:07:53.329
Arthur Samuel had this important idea in machine learning that we need some way to figure out how

0:07:54.300,0:08:01.759
Good our how well our model is doing so that when we change the parameters we can figure out which set of parameters make that

0:08:02.880,0:08:04.880
Performance measurement get better or worse

0:08:05.190,0:08:07.669
That performance measurement is called the loss

0:08:08.190,0:08:09.900
the loss is

0:08:09.900,0:08:13.489
Not necessarily the same as your metric

0:08:14.670,0:08:19.850
the reason why is a bit subtle and we'll be seeing it in a lot of detail once we delve into the math in the

0:08:19.850,0:08:21.850
coming lessons, but basically

0:08:22.560,0:08:26.869
You need a function. You need a loss function

0:08:27.390,0:08:33.470
Where if you change the parameters by just a little bit up or just a little bit down you can see if the loss gets

0:08:33.470,0:08:39.739
A little bit better or a little bit worse and it turns out that error rate and accuracy doesn't tell you that at all

0:08:39.990,0:08:43.370
Because you might change the parameters base much such a small amount

0:08:43.920,0:08:49.499
That none of your dog's predictions start becoming hats and none of your cat predictions start becoming dogs

0:08:49.500,0:08:53.609
So like your predictions don't change and your error rate doesn't change so

0:08:54.400,0:08:59.249
Loss and metric are closely related, but the metric is the thing that you care about

0:08:59.980,0:09:07.110
The loss is the thing which your computer is using as the measurement of performance to decide how to update your parameters

0:09:08.920,0:09:10.920
So we measure

0:09:11.860,0:09:17.490
Overfitting by looking at the metrics on the validation set so fast AI

0:09:17.860,0:09:21.210
always uses the validation set to print out your metrics and

0:09:22.480,0:09:29.970
Overfitting is like the key thing that machine learning is about it's all about. How do we find a model?

0:09:30.640,0:09:37.949
Which fits the data not just for the data that we're training with but for data that the training algorithm hasn't seen before

0:09:41.170,0:09:42.760
So

0:09:42.760,0:09:43.960
overfitting

0:09:43.960,0:09:45.520
results when

0:09:45.520,0:09:47.520
our model is basically

0:09:47.890,0:09:51.059
Cheating a model can cheat by saying

0:09:51.060,0:09:51.670
Oh

0:09:51.670,0:09:56.969
I've seen this exact picture before and I remember that that's a picture of a cat

0:09:57.400,0:10:00.719
So it might not have learnt what cats look like in general

0:10:00.720,0:10:01.360
It just remembers

0:10:01.360,0:10:07.050
you know that images one four and eight cats and two and three and five dogs and

0:10:07.450,0:10:12.989
Learns nothing actually about what they really look like. So that's the kind of cheating that we're trying to avoid

0:10:12.990,0:10:14.990
we don't want it to memorize our

0:10:15.250,0:10:17.250
particular data set

0:10:17.980,0:10:19.980
So we sped off our validation data

0:10:20.530,0:10:25.559
And what most of this are these words you're seeing on the screen are from the book. Okay, so I just copied and pasted them

0:10:26.950,0:10:29.009
so if we split off our validation data

0:10:30.010,0:10:35.729
And make sure that our model sees it during training. It's completely untainted by it so we can't possibly cheat

0:10:36.790,0:10:38.849
Not quite true we can cheat

0:10:39.460,0:10:45.599
The way we could cheat is we could run we could fit a model look at the result and the validation set

0:10:46.120,0:10:48.719
Change something a little bit fit another model

0:10:48.720,0:10:52.200
Look at the validation set change something a little bit we could do that like a hundred times

0:10:53.050,0:10:55.770
Until we find something with the validation set looks the best

0:10:56.350,0:10:58.710
But now we might have fit to the validation set

0:10:59.230,0:11:04.779
Right. So if you want to be really rigorous about this, you should actually set aside a third

0:11:05.330,0:11:11.470
Bit of data called the test set that is not used for training and it's not used for your metrics

0:11:12.320,0:11:15.249
It's actually you don't look at it until the Haab projects finished

0:11:15.920,0:11:19.149
And this is what's used on competition platforms like Kegel

0:11:20.060,0:11:23.380
on Kegel after the competition finishes

0:11:24.200,0:11:26.560
Your performance will be measured

0:11:27.260,0:11:29.500
Against a data set that you have never seen

0:11:30.410,0:11:32.410
and so

0:11:32.990,0:11:34.990
That's a really helpful

0:11:35.390,0:11:40.030
Approach and it's actually a great idea to do that. Like even if you're not doing the modeling yourself

0:11:40.700,0:11:42.230
so if you're

0:11:42.230,0:11:44.529
If you're looking at vendors

0:11:44.530,0:11:51.550
And you're just trying to decide today go with IBM or Google or Microsoft and they're all showing you how great their models are

0:11:52.820,0:11:56.379
What you should do is you should say okay you go and build your models

0:11:56.780,0:12:02.019
And I am going to hang on to 10% of my data and I'm not going to let you see it at all

0:12:02.450,0:12:08.050
And when you're all finished to come back and then I'll run your model on the tip as 10% of data. You've never seen

0:12:09.320,0:12:11.320
now

0:12:12.470,0:12:14.210
Pulling out your

0:12:14.210,0:12:16.840
Validation and test sets is a bit subtle, though

0:12:17.690,0:12:22.149
here's an example of a simple little data set and this comes from a

0:12:23.000,0:12:28.419
Fantastic blog post that Rachel wrote that we will link to about creating effective validation sets

0:12:29.390,0:12:35.170
And you can see basically you have some kind of seasonal data set here. Now if you just say

0:12:35.750,0:12:38.529
okay, first day I want to model that I want to create a

0:12:39.230,0:12:43.570
My data loader using a valid percent of 0.2

0:12:44.420,0:12:48.250
It would do this. It would delete randomly some of the dots

0:12:49.190,0:12:51.190
right now

0:12:51.380,0:12:53.210
This isn't very helpful

0:12:53.210,0:12:58.449
Because it's we can still cheat because these dots are right in the middle of other dots

0:12:58.940,0:13:00.670
And this isn't what would happen in practice?

0:13:00.670,0:13:05.110
What would happen in practice is we would want to predict this is sales by date, right?

0:13:05.110,0:13:08.620
We want to predict the sales for next week. Not the sales for

0:13:09.200,0:13:12.539
14 days ago 18 days ago and 29 days ago, okay

0:13:13.089,0:13:18.178
So what you actually need to do to create an effective validation set here is not do it randomly. But instead

0:13:19.179,0:13:20.649
chop off

0:13:20.649,0:13:22.149
the end

0:13:22.149,0:13:29.368
Right. And so this is what happens in all kaggle competitions pretty much that involve time for instance is the thing that you have to

0:13:29.369,0:13:34.979
Predict is the next like two weeks or so after the last data point that they give you

0:13:35.889,0:13:38.459
And this is what you should do also for your test set

0:13:38.920,0:13:42.569
So again, if you've got vendors that you're looking at you should say to them

0:13:42.569,0:13:48.269
Okay, after you're all done modeling, we're going to check your model against a data

0:13:48.269,0:13:50.789
that is one week later than you've ever seen before and

0:13:51.339,0:13:55.018
You won't be able to retrain or anything because that's what happens in practice, right?

0:13:56.619,0:14:00.119
Oops, there's a question. I've heard people describe

0:14:00.639,0:14:07.048
Overfitting as training error being below validation error. Does this rule of thumb end up being roughly the same as yours?

0:14:07.569,0:14:09.420
Okay, so that's a great question

0:14:09.420,0:14:14.429
So I think what they mean, there is training loss versus validation loss

0:14:15.189,0:14:17.519
Because we don't print training error

0:14:18.040,0:14:24.449
so we do print at the end of each epoch the value of your loss function for the training set and the value of the

0:14:24.449,0:14:26.789
loss function for the validation set and

0:14:28.329,0:14:32.428
If you train for long enough that's so so if it's training mostly

0:14:33.160,0:14:36.449
Your training loss will go down and your validation loss will go down

0:14:37.480,0:14:39.480
because by definition

0:14:40.989,0:14:45.449
Loss function is to find such as a lower loss function is a better model

0:14:46.329,0:14:48.329
if you start overfitting

0:14:48.369,0:14:55.949
Your training loss will keep going down. Right because like why wouldn't it, you know, you're getting better and better parameters

0:14:57.790,0:15:00.360
But your validation loss will start to go up

0:15:01.149,0:15:06.928
Because actually you started fitting to the specific data points in the training set. And so it's not going to actually get better

0:15:06.929,0:15:10.319
It's going to get it's not going to get better for the validation set. It'll start to get worse

0:15:11.470,0:15:13.329
however

0:15:13.329,0:15:14.769
That does not

0:15:14.769,0:15:20.128
Necessarily mean that you're overfitting or at least not overfitting in a bad way as we'll see

0:15:20.379,0:15:23.639
It's actually possible to be at a point where the validation

0:15:24.279,0:15:30.118
Loss is getting worse but the validation accuracy or error or metric is still improving

0:15:31.269,0:15:33.220
So I'm not going to describe

0:15:33.220,0:15:37.290
How that would happen mathematically yet because we need to learn more about loss functions

0:15:37.290,0:15:43.379
But we will but for now just realize that the important thing to look at is your metric

0:15:44.110,0:15:48.389
Getting worse not your loss function getting worse

0:15:49.749,0:15:51.749
Thank you for that. Fantastic question

0:15:55.689,0:16:03.178
The next important thing we need to learn about is called transfer learning. So the next line of code said learned fine tuned

0:16:03.699,0:16:05.699
Why does it say learn dot fine to?

0:16:06.220,0:16:08.459
Fine tune is what we do when we are

0:16:08.980,0:16:16.559
Transfer learning so transfer learning is using a pre trained model for a task that is different to what it was originally trained for

0:16:16.809,0:16:23.969
So more. Jargon to understand our jargon, let's look at that. What's a pre trained model? So what happens is remember?

0:16:23.970,0:16:26.850
I told you the architecture we're using is called resonate 34

0:16:27.819,0:16:32.279
So when we take that resonate 34, that's just a just a mathematical function

0:16:32.619,0:16:37.169
Okay with lots of parameters that we're going to fit using machine learning

0:16:40.420,0:16:46.649
There's a big data set called imagenet that contains 1.3 million pictures of a thousand different types of thing

0:16:47.949,0:16:52.618
Mushrooms or animals or aeroplanes or hammers or whatever?

0:16:54.730,0:16:59.189
There's a competition or they used to be a competition that runs every year to see who could get the best

0:16:59.529,0:17:03.448
Accuracy on the imagenet competition and the models that did really well

0:17:04.240,0:17:05.889
people would take

0:17:05.889,0:17:12.359
Those specific values of those parameters and they would make them available on the internet for anybody to download

0:17:12.610,0:17:17.130
So if you download that you don't just have an architecture now you have a trained model

0:17:17.230,0:17:20.730
You have a model that can recognize a thousand

0:17:21.880,0:17:24.510
categories of thing in images

0:17:25.779,0:17:31.169
Which probably isn't very useful unless you happen to want something that recognizes those exact thousand categories of thing

0:17:32.260,0:17:34.260
But it turns out you can

0:17:36.370,0:17:42.209
Rather you can with those weights in your model and then train some more epochs

0:17:43.000,0:17:46.949
On your data and you'll end up with a far far more

0:17:47.230,0:17:53.610
Accurate model than you would if you didn't start with that pre train model and we'll see why in just a moment, right?

0:17:54.610,0:17:58.829
But this idea of transfer learning it's kind of it makes intuitive sense, right?

0:18:00.429,0:18:04.649
Imagenet already has some cats and some dogs and it's you know

0:18:04.650,0:18:06.779
It can say this is a cat and this is a dog

0:18:06.779,0:18:10.889
But you want to maybe do something that recognizes lots of breeds that aren't an image net

0:18:11.529,0:18:18.719
Well for it to be able to recognize cats versus dogs versus airplanes versus hammers. It has to understand things like

0:18:19.720,0:18:26.339
What does metal look like what is fur look like what it is look like you know so it can say like oh this breed

0:18:26.340,0:18:31.770
Of animal this breed of dog has pointy ears and oh this thing is metal. So it can't be a dog

0:18:32.529,0:18:37.709
So all these kinds of concepts get implicitly learned by a pre trained model

0:18:38.470,0:18:42.839
So if you start with a pre trained model, then you don't it. You don't have to learn all these features

0:18:43.630,0:18:47.849
from scratch and so transfer learning is the

0:18:48.370,0:18:55.679
Single most important thing for being able to use less data and less compute and get better accuracy

0:18:56.080,0:19:01.500
So that's a key focus for the FASTA eye library and a key focus for this course

0:19:03.820,0:19:10.590
There's a question and I am a bit confused on the differences between loss error and metric

0:19:14.559,0:19:16.559
Sure, so

0:19:19.029,0:19:21.029
Era is just one

0:19:21.460,0:19:27.840
Kind of metric. So there's lots of different possible labels. You could have let's say you are trying to create a model

0:19:28.360,0:19:30.599
which could predict how old a

0:19:31.240,0:19:33.220
cat or dog is

0:19:33.220,0:19:34.510
so

0:19:34.510,0:19:39.569
The metric you might use is on average how many years were you off by?

0:19:41.590,0:19:48.209
So that would be a metric on the other hand if you're trying to predict whether this is a cat or a dog

0:19:48.700,0:19:50.669
Your metric would be

0:19:50.669,0:19:52.669
What percentage of the time am I wrong?

0:19:53.230,0:20:00.809
So that latter metric is called the error rate. Okay, so error is one particular metric. It's a thing that measures

0:20:01.359,0:20:05.879
How well you're doing and it's like it should be the thing that you most care about

0:20:06.039,0:20:09.959
So you you write a function or use one of fast a i's predefined ones

0:20:11.019,0:20:13.019
Which measures how well you're doing?

0:20:15.820,0:20:17.769
Loss

0:20:17.769,0:20:22.049
Is the thing that we talked about in Lesson one, so I'll give a quick summary

0:20:22.059,0:20:24.059
But go back to lesson one if you don't remember

0:20:24.970,0:20:29.939
Arthur Samuel talked about how a machine learning model needs some measure of performance

0:20:31.269,0:20:38.638
Which we can look at when we adjust our parameters our pour down. Does that measure of performance get better or worse and

0:20:39.609,0:20:41.609
as I mentioned earlier

0:20:42.519,0:20:44.519
Some metrics

0:20:44.710,0:20:50.999
Possibly won't change at all if you move the parameters up and down just a little bit so they can't be used

0:20:51.609,0:20:56.789
For this purpose of adjusting the parameters to find a better measure of performance. So quite often

0:20:56.789,0:20:59.309
We need to use a different function

0:20:59.309,0:21:01.309
we call this the loss function and

0:21:01.389,0:21:07.139
the loss function is the measure of performance that the algorithm uses to try to make the parameters better and

0:21:07.509,0:21:13.229
It's something which should kind of track pretty closely to the the metric you care about

0:21:13.869,0:21:20.159
But it's something which as you change the parameters a bit the loss should always change a bit

0:21:20.159,0:21:21.159
and so

0:21:21.159,0:21:22.779
There's a lot of hand waving there

0:21:22.779,0:21:27.659
Because we need to look at some of the math of how that works and we'll be doing that in the next couple of lessons

0:21:31.450,0:21:33.450
Thanks to their great questions

0:21:35.499,0:21:41.579
Okay, so fine tuning is a particular transfer learning technique where the

0:21:42.519,0:21:45.508
When you're still showing your picture and not the slides

0:21:51.350,0:21:56.600
So fine-tuning is a transfer learning technique where the weights this is not quite the right word

0:21:56.600,0:22:02.809
We should say the parameters where the parameters of a pre-trained model are updated by training for additional epochs

0:22:03.030,0:22:05.689
Using a different task to that used for pre training

0:22:05.690,0:22:13.400
So pre training the tasks that have been imaged met classification and then our different tasks might be recognizing cats versus dogs

0:22:15.990,0:22:17.990
So the way

0:22:18.690,0:22:24.650
By default fast AI does fine tuning is that we use one epoch, which remember is one

0:22:25.799,0:22:32.779
looking at every image in the data set once one epoch to fit just those parts of the model necessary to

0:22:33.390,0:22:36.349
Get the particular part of the model. That's

0:22:36.870,0:22:39.409
Especially for your data set working

0:22:40.020,0:22:41.730
And then we use

0:22:41.730,0:22:44.900
as many epochs as you asked for to fit the whole model and

0:22:45.000,0:22:48.319
So this is more if you for those people who might be a bit more advanced

0:22:48.320,0:22:52.460
We'll see exactly how this works later on in the lessons

0:22:53.789,0:22:57.139
So why does transfer learning work and why does it work? So well?

0:22:58.049,0:23:04.099
the best way in my opinion to look at this is to see this paper by Zeiler and furgus who were actually

0:23:05.700,0:23:07.700
2012 imagenet winners and

0:23:08.340,0:23:09.809
interestingly

0:23:09.809,0:23:16.309
Their key insights came from their ability to visualize what's going on inside a model and so our visualization

0:23:16.470,0:23:19.459
Very often turns out to be super important to getting great results

0:23:20.520,0:23:25.489
What they were able to do was they looked remember I told you like a resinate 34 has 34 layers

0:23:26.400,0:23:28.320
They looked at

0:23:28.320,0:23:34.909
Something called Alec's net which was the previous winner of the competition, which only had seven layers at the time that was considered huge

0:23:35.580,0:23:40.580
And so they took the seven layer model and they said what is the first layer of?

0:23:40.950,0:23:46.340
Parameters look like and they figured it out how to draw a picture of them, right?

0:23:46.340,0:23:49.340
and so the first layer had

0:23:50.970,0:23:56.900
Lots and lots of features but here are nine of them. One, two, three, four, five six, seven eight nine and

0:23:57.960,0:24:00.620
Here's what nine of those pictures look like

0:24:00.620,0:24:04.219
One of them was something that could recognize diagonal lines from top left to bottom

0:24:04.470,0:24:04.960
right

0:24:04.960,0:24:08.039
One of them could find diagonal lines from bottom left to top right?

0:24:08.320,0:24:12.179
one of them could find gradients that went from the top of orange to the bottom of

0:24:12.909,0:24:18.389
Blue some of them were able, you know, one of them was specifically for finding things that were green

0:24:19.030,0:24:22.530
And so forth right so for each of these nine

0:24:24.549,0:24:26.939
They're called filters there are features

0:24:28.659,0:24:32.009
So then something really interesting they did was they looked at for each one of these

0:24:32.799,0:24:38.999
Each one of these filters each one of these features and we'll learn kind of mathematically about what these actually mean

0:24:39.730,0:24:41.650
In the coming lessons, but for now

0:24:41.650,0:24:46.169
Let's just recognize them and saying oh there's something that looks at diagonal lines and something that looks at gradients

0:24:46.690,0:24:50.280
And they found in the actual images in imagenet

0:24:52.390,0:24:59.339
Specific examples of parts of photos that match that filter so for this top left filter here are nine

0:25:00.130,0:25:04.559
actual patches of real photos that match that filter and as you can see

0:25:04.559,0:25:11.399
They're all diagonal lines. And so here's the four the green one. Here's parts of actual photos that match the green one

0:25:11.950,0:25:18.210
So layer one is super super simple. And one of the interesting things to note here. Is that something that can recognize?

0:25:18.730,0:25:24.030
Gradients and patches of color and lines is likely to be useful for lots of other tasks as well

0:25:24.030,0:25:28.169
Not just imagenet so you can kind of see how something that can do this

0:25:29.020,0:25:31.020
might also be good at

0:25:31.419,0:25:34.079
Many many other computer vision tasks as well

0:25:35.380,0:25:37.380
This is layer 2 layer

0:25:37.390,0:25:41.579
2 takes the features of layer 1 and combines them

0:25:42.429,0:25:48.029
so it can not just find edges that can find corners or

0:25:49.299,0:25:57.089
Repeating curving patterns or semi circles or full circles. And so you can see for example, here's a

0:25:58.990,0:26:02.760
It's kind of hard to exactly visualize these

0:26:04.419,0:26:09.359
Layers after layer 1 you kind of have to show examples of what the filters look like

0:26:10.150,0:26:17.009
but here you can see examples of parts of photos that these this layer 2 circular filter has

0:26:17.840,0:26:19.840
activated on

0:26:20.030,0:26:22.869
And as you can see, it's found things with circles

0:26:23.390,0:26:30.490
so interestingly this one which is this kind of blotchy gradient seems to be very good at finding sunsets and

0:26:30.950,0:26:35.649
this repeating vertical pattern is very good at finding like curtains and wheat

0:26:36.380,0:26:38.330
fields and stuff

0:26:38.330,0:26:44.139
So the further we get layer three then gets to combine all the kinds of features in layer

0:26:44.540,0:26:50.920
Two and remember, we're only seeing Zoar anything here are twelve of the features, but actually there's probably hundreds of them

0:26:50.920,0:26:53.320
I don't remember exactly an alux net, but there's lots

0:26:53.750,0:27:00.700
But by the time we get to layer three by combining features from layer two, it already has something which is finding

0:27:01.700,0:27:06.189
Text so this is a feature which can find bits of image that contain text

0:27:07.130,0:27:09.130
It's already got something which can find

0:27:10.130,0:27:13.780
repeating geometric patterns and you see this is not just like a

0:27:15.710,0:27:18.340
Matching specific pixel patterns. This is like a

0:27:19.190,0:27:24.249
Semantic concept it can find repeating circles or repeating squares or repeating hexagons

0:27:24.920,0:27:28.450
Great, so it's it's really like computing. It's not just

0:27:29.240,0:27:36.700
Matching a template and remember we know that neural networks can solve any possible computable function so it can certainly do that

0:27:38.960,0:27:41.710
So layer four gets to combine

0:27:42.290,0:27:48.489
All the filters from layer three anyway at once and so by layer four, we have something that can find dog faces

0:27:49.220,0:27:51.220
for instance

0:27:51.470,0:27:53.470
so you can kind of see how

0:27:54.410,0:27:59.499
Each layer, we get like more applicative lis more sophisticated features

0:27:59.630,0:28:04.360
And so that's why these deep neural networks can be so incredibly powerful

0:28:05.150,0:28:11.200
It's also why transfer learning can work so well because like if we wanted something that can find

0:28:11.990,0:28:15.550
Books, and I don't think there's a book category in imagenet

0:28:15.680,0:28:21.549
Well, it's actually already got something that can find text as an earlier filter, which I guess it must be using to find

0:28:21.560,0:28:24.700
Maybe there's a category for library or something or a bookshelf

0:28:26.390,0:28:32.660
So when you use transfer learning you can take advantage of all of these pre I learnt

0:28:33.150,0:28:38.089
Features to find things that are as combinations of these or existing features

0:28:38.310,0:28:45.440
That's why transfer learning can be done so much more quickly and so much less data than traditional approaches

0:28:47.250,0:28:53.119
One important thing to realize then is that these techniques for computer vision are not just good at

0:28:53.700,0:28:55.170
recognizing photos

0:28:55.170,0:29:01.430
There's all kinds of things you can turn into pictures. For example, these are example these are

0:29:01.980,0:29:08.329
sounds that have been tuned into pictures by representing their frequencies over time and

0:29:09.120,0:29:13.880
It turns out that if you convert a sound into these kinds of pictures

0:29:14.580,0:29:18.380
You can get basically state-of-the-art results at sound detection

0:29:19.260,0:29:22.489
Just by using the exact same resonate

0:29:23.160,0:29:25.160
learner that we've already seen

0:29:25.860,0:29:29.449
We need to highlight that it's 945. So if you want to take a break soon

0:29:30.720,0:29:32.720
a really cool example

0:29:33.000,0:29:37.640
From I think this is our very first year of running fast AI one of our students

0:29:38.880,0:29:45.499
Created pictures they worked at Splunk in anti-fraud and they created pictures of users moving their mouths

0:29:45.500,0:29:48.530
And if I remember correctly as they moved their mouths

0:29:48.740,0:29:55.310
He basically drew a picture of where the mouse moved and the color depended on how fast they moved and these

0:29:55.830,0:29:59.630
circular blobs is where they clicked the left or the right mouse button and

0:30:00.570,0:30:05.389
It's blank. They then well, he what he did actually for the through the course as a

0:30:06.210,0:30:12.560
Project for the course is he tried to see whether he could use this these pictures with exactly the same approach?

0:30:12.560,0:30:17.839
We saw in lesson 1 to create an anti fraud model and it worked

0:30:17.840,0:30:24.620
So well that Splunk ended up patenting a new product based on this technique and you can actually check it out

0:30:24.620,0:30:30.859
there's a blog post about it on the internet where they describe this breakthrough anti-fraud approach which literally came from

0:30:32.190,0:30:37.219
One of our really amazing and brilliant and creative students after lesson one of the course

0:30:39.180,0:30:43.580
Another cool example of this is looking at different

0:30:44.880,0:30:46.380
viruses and

0:30:46.380,0:30:51.109
Again, turning them into pictures and you can kind of see how they've got here. This is from a paper

0:30:51.630,0:30:53.630
Check out the book for the citation

0:30:54.240,0:30:58.729
they've got three examples of a particular virus called VB 80 and another

0:30:59.070,0:31:05.179
example of a particular virus called fake rien and you can see each case the pictures all look kind of similar and

0:31:05.850,0:31:06.800
That's why again

0:31:06.800,0:31:11.900
they can get state-of-the-art results in in virus detection by turning the

0:31:12.300,0:31:16.610
Kind of program signatures into pictures and putting it through image recognition

0:31:20.040,0:31:25.820
So in the book you'll find a list of all of the terms all of the most important terms

0:31:25.820,0:31:29.270
We've seen both so far and what they mean. I'm not going to read through them

0:31:29.270,0:31:35.270
but I want you to please because these are the these are the terms that we're going to be using from now on and

0:31:35.520,0:31:37.520
You've got to know what they mean

0:31:37.710,0:31:43.789
because if you don't you're going to be really confused because I'll be talking about labels and architectures and models and parameters and

0:31:44.130,0:31:50.359
They have very specific exact meanings and they'll be using those exact meanings. So please review this

0:31:51.990,0:31:58.909
So to remind you this is where we got to we we ended up with Arthur Samuels overall

0:31:59.970,0:32:05.299
Approach and we replaced his terms with our terms. So we have an architecture

0:32:05.970,0:32:12.380
Which contains parameters as inputs and we more parameters and the data as inputs?

0:32:13.200,0:32:16.669
So that the architecture press the parameters of the model

0:32:17.850,0:32:20.480
With the inputs they used to calculate predictions

0:32:20.820,0:32:26.990
They are compared to the labels with a loss function and that loss function is used to update the parameters

0:32:27.600,0:32:32.449
Many many times to make them better and better until the loss gets nice and super low

0:32:34.890,0:32:37.279
So this is the end of chapter 1 of the book

0:32:38.010,0:32:44.059
it's really important to look at the questionnaire because the questionnaire is the thing where you can check whether you

0:32:45.640,0:32:52.020
Have taken away from this book of this chapter the stuff that we hope you have so go through it and

0:32:53.380,0:32:57.599
Anything that you're not sure about the tech that the answer is in the text

0:32:57.640,0:33:02.640
So just go back to earlier in the book and you will in the chapter and you will find the answers

0:33:04.390,0:33:10.950
There's also a further research section after each questionnaire for the first couple of chapters, they're actually pretty simple

0:33:11.050,0:33:16.380
Hopefully they're pretty fun and interesting. They're things were to answer the question. It's not enough to just look in the chapter

0:33:16.900,0:33:22.410
You actually have to go and do your own thinking and experimenting and googling and so forth

0:33:23.260,0:33:30.600
In later chapters, some of these further research things are pretty significant projects that might take a few days or even weeks

0:33:31.210,0:33:32.980
and so

0:33:32.980,0:33:35.939
yeah, you know check them out because hopefully they'll be a great way to

0:33:36.820,0:33:38.820
Expand your understanding of the material

0:33:41.200,0:33:45.990
So something that still found points out in the book is that if you really want to make the most of this

0:33:46.150,0:33:47.550
then after each chapter

0:33:47.550,0:33:54.419
Please take the time to experiment with your own project and within the books you provide we provide and then see if you can

0:33:55.090,0:33:59.699
Redo the the notebooks on a new data set and perhaps for chapter one

0:33:59.700,0:34:04.169
That might be a bit hard because we haven't really shown how to change things but for chapter four chapter two

0:34:04.540,0:34:07.440
Which we're going to start next you'll absolutely be able to do that

0:34:08.920,0:34:15.089
Okay, so let's take a break and we'll come back at 9:55

0:34:16.390,0:34:18.390
San Francisco time

0:34:18.970,0:34:25.770
Okay, so welcome back everybody and I think we've got a couple of questions to start with. So Rachel, please take it away. Sure

0:34:26.530,0:34:29.130
Our filters independent by that

0:34:29.130,0:34:35.430
I mean if filters are pre-trained might they become less good and detecting features of previous images when fine-tuned. Oh

0:34:36.340,0:34:38.340
That is a great question

0:34:39.460,0:34:47.310
So assuming I understand the question correctly if if you start with say an image NIT model and then you you fine-tune it on

0:34:47.890,0:34:54.299
Dogs versus cats for a few epochs and you get something that's very good at recognizing dogs versus cats

0:34:56.380,0:34:58.900
It's got to be much less good as an image net model after that

0:34:58.910,0:35:03.879
So it's not going to be very good at recognizing aeroplanes or or hammers or whatever

0:35:05.810,0:35:07.810
This is called catastrophic

0:35:07.850,0:35:12.190
Forgetting in the literature the idea that as you like see more images

0:35:12.260,0:35:16.960
About different things to what you saw earlier that you start to forget what the things you saw earlier?

0:35:18.860,0:35:22.150
So if you want to fine-tune something which is

0:35:22.850,0:35:27.009
Good at a new task but also continues to be good at the previous task

0:35:27.010,0:35:30.700
You need to keep putting in examples of the previous task as well

0:35:33.800,0:35:38.890
And what are the example what are the differences between parameters and hyper parameters

0:35:40.070,0:35:46.150
If I am feeding an image of a dog as an input and then changing the hyper parameters of batch size and the model

0:35:46.280,0:35:48.370
What would be an example of a parameter?

0:35:49.880,0:35:52.150
So the parameters are the things that

0:35:53.540,0:35:58.240
are described in lesson one that Arthur Samuel described as being

0:35:59.870,0:36:01.870
The things which change

0:36:02.060,0:36:08.769
What the model does what the architecture does so we start with this infinitely flexible function

0:36:08.770,0:36:11.860
The thing called a neural network that can do anything at all

0:36:12.860,0:36:14.600
and

0:36:14.600,0:36:15.740
the

0:36:15.740,0:36:21.009
The way you get it to do one thing versus another thing is by changing its parameters. They're there

0:36:21.010,0:36:27.070
They are the numbers that you pass into that function. So there's two types of numbers you pass into the function

0:36:27.070,0:36:34.059
There's the numbers that represent your input like the pixels of your dog. And there's the numbers that represent

0:36:35.720,0:36:37.720
Their learnt parameters

0:36:38.150,0:36:42.430
So in the example of something that's not a neural net but like a checkers playing program

0:36:43.070,0:36:49.330
Like Arthur Samuel might have used back in the early 60s and late 50s. Those parameters may have been things like

0:36:50.600,0:36:52.600
if there is a

0:36:53.240,0:36:57.099
Opportunity to take a piece versus an opportunity to get to the end of a board

0:36:57.950,0:37:01.599
How much more value should I consider one versus the other?

0:37:01.870,0:37:07.120
You know, it's twice as important or it's three times as important that two versus three, that would be an example of a parameter

0:37:09.060,0:37:10.410
In a

0:37:10.410,0:37:12.000
neural network

0:37:12.000,0:37:19.069
Parameters are a much more abstract concept and so a detailed understanding of what they are will come in the next lesson or two

0:37:19.590,0:37:23.990
But it's the same basic idea there the numbers which change

0:37:25.020,0:37:28.640
What the model does to be something that recognizes?

0:37:29.550,0:37:35.060
malignant tumors versus cats versus dogs versus colorizer splack and white pictures

0:37:36.810,0:37:38.810
Whereas the hyper parameter is

0:37:39.420,0:37:41.420
the choices about

0:37:41.940,0:37:43.110
What?

0:37:43.110,0:37:49.670
What numbers do you pass to the function when you act the actual fitting function to decide how that fitting process happens?

0:37:50.580,0:37:52.020
it

0:37:52.020,0:37:57.140
There's a question. I'm curious about the pacing of this course. I'm concerned that all the material may not be covered

0:37:58.350,0:38:02.420
It depends what you mean by all the material we certainly won't cover everything in the world

0:38:03.720,0:38:05.720
So yeah

0:38:07.110,0:38:10.370
We'll cover what we can well cover what we can in seven lessons

0:38:11.790,0:38:18.440
We're certainly not covering the whole book if that's what you're wondering. The whole book will be covered in either two or three courses

0:38:19.320,0:38:23.600
In the past. It's generally been two courses to cover about the amount of stuff in the book

0:38:24.750,0:38:28.909
But we'll see how it goes because the books pretty big 500 pages

0:38:29.190,0:38:32.569
So when you say two courses you mean fourteen lesson 14

0:38:32.570,0:38:35.870
Yes, it would be like 14 or 21 lessons to get through the whole book

0:38:37.530,0:38:39.740
Well, though having said that by the end of the first lesson

0:38:39.840,0:38:45.350
Hopefully there'll be kind of like enough momentum and understanding that the reading the book independently will be more

0:38:45.780,0:38:47.930
useful and you'll have also kind of

0:38:49.200,0:38:54.049
Gained a community of folks on the forums that you can hang out with and ask questions of and so forth

0:38:56.580,0:39:03.620
So in in the second part of the course, we're going to be talking about putting stuff in production and

0:39:05.280,0:39:09.830
We're so to do that we need to understand like what are the capabilities and limitations of

0:39:11.100,0:39:13.100
Deep learning what are the kinds of?

0:39:13.290,0:39:16.250
projects that even makes sense to try to put in production

0:39:17.100,0:39:20.809
And you know one of the key things I should mention in the book and in this core

0:39:20.940,0:39:23.669
Is that the first two or three lessons and chapters?

0:39:24.310,0:39:27.600
there's a lot of stuff which is designed not just for

0:39:28.150,0:39:33.359
the coders but for for everybody there's lots of information about like

0:39:34.270,0:39:37.409
What are the practical things you need to know to make deep learning work?

0:39:37.450,0:39:42.329
And so one of them things you need to know is like well what's deep learning actually good at at the moment

0:39:43.870,0:39:46.740
So I'll summarize what the book says about this but

0:39:47.560,0:39:50.250
there are the kind of four key areas that we

0:39:51.100,0:39:54.539
Have as applications in faster a computer vision text

0:39:54.850,0:40:02.309
Tabular and what I've called here XE assistance for recommendation systems and specifically a technique called collaborative filtering which we briefly saw

0:40:02.890,0:40:10.589
Sorry, another question and is are there any pre trained weights available other than the ones from imagenet that we can use if?

0:40:10.750,0:40:14.520
Yes, when should we use others in one imagenet? Oh, that's a really great question

0:40:15.370,0:40:16.810
so

0:40:16.810,0:40:20.730
yes, there are a lot of pre trained models and

0:40:21.370,0:40:26.280
One way to find them. But also you're currently just showing us what you can great

0:40:27.370,0:40:29.819
Now one great way to find them is you can look up

0:40:31.540,0:40:33.540
Models ooh

0:40:33.580,0:40:38.430
Which is a common name for like places that have lots of different models

0:40:39.760,0:40:43.289
And so here's lots of models is or you can look for

0:40:44.920,0:40:46.920
Pre-trained models

0:40:49.030,0:40:53.609
And so yeah, there's quite a few um, unfortunately

0:40:55.750,0:41:03.599
Not as wide a variety as I would like that most is still on image net or similar kinds of general photos

0:41:04.240,0:41:06.689
for example medical imaging there's hardly any

0:41:08.980,0:41:14.010
There's a lot of opportunities for people to create domain-specific pre-trained models, it's it's still an area

0:41:14.010,0:41:17.549
That's really underdone because not enough people are working on transfer learning

0:41:20.569,0:41:27.489
Okay, so as I was mentioning we've kind of got these four applications that we've talked about a bit

0:41:28.880,0:41:34.569
And deep learning is pretty, you know, pretty good at all of those

0:41:36.529,0:41:43.268
Tabular data like spreadsheets and database tables is an area where dick learning is not always the best choice

0:41:43.549,0:41:47.528
But it's particularly good for things involving high cardinality variables

0:41:47.599,0:41:52.509
that means variables that have like lots and lots of discrete levels like zip code or

0:41:53.059,0:41:55.239
Product ID or something like that

0:41:56.079,0:41:59.349
deep loadings really pretty great for those in particular

0:42:02.779,0:42:07.599
For text it's pretty great at things like classification and translation

0:42:08.059,0:42:14.169
It's actually terrible for conversation. And so that's that's been something that's been a huge disappointment for a lot of companies

0:42:14.170,0:42:16.359
I tried to create these like conversation BOTS

0:42:17.299,0:42:19.509
but actually deep learning isn't good at

0:42:20.329,0:42:22.309
providing accurate information

0:42:22.309,0:42:26.319
it's good at providing things that sound accurate and sound compelling but

0:42:26.390,0:42:29.680
That we don't really have great ways yet of actually making sure it's correct

0:42:33.559,0:42:37.959
One big issue for recommendation systems collaborative filtering is that

0:42:38.960,0:42:41.019
Deep learning is focused on making predictions

0:42:42.259,0:42:48.459
Which don't necessarily actually mean creating useful recommendations. We'll see what that means in a moment

0:42:49.789,0:42:52.569
Deep learning is also good at multimodal

0:42:53.269,0:42:55.269
That means things where you've got

0:42:55.970,0:43:02.139
Multiple different types of data so you might have some tabular data including a text column and an image

0:43:03.650,0:43:05.710
Then some collaborative filtering data

0:43:06.349,0:43:09.699
And combining that all together is something that deep learning is really good at

0:43:10.519,0:43:12.519
so for example

0:43:13.309,0:43:19.569
Putting captions on photos is something which deep learning is pretty good at although again

0:43:19.569,0:43:21.289
It's not very good at being accurate

0:43:21.289,0:43:26.289
So what you know might say this is a picture of two birds when it's actually a picture of three birds

0:43:27.829,0:43:29.829
And then this other category

0:43:30.880,0:43:31.930
there's

0:43:31.930,0:43:38.550
Lots and lots of things that you can do with deep learning by being creative about the use of these kinds of other

0:43:39.160,0:43:46.080
Application based approaches for example an approach that we developed for natural language processing called you LM fit

0:43:46.080,0:43:48.080
They're all you're learning in the course

0:43:48.670,0:43:55.200
It turns out that it's also fantastic you're doing protein analysis. If you think of the different proteins as being different words

0:43:56.200,0:44:00.030
And they're in a sequence which has some kind of state and meaning

0:44:00.490,0:44:07.409
It turns out that you will M fit works really well for protein analysis so often it's about kind of being being creative

0:44:08.350,0:44:13.649
So to decide like for the product that you're trying to build is deep learning gonna work

0:44:14.290,0:44:17.969
Well for it in the end you kind of just have to try it and see

0:44:20.800,0:44:26.370
But if you if you do a search, you know, hopefully you can find examples about the people that have tried something similar

0:44:27.040,0:44:30.060
Even if you can't that doesn't mean it's not going to work

0:44:31.780,0:44:38.790
So, for example, I mentioned the collaborative filtering issue where a recommendation and a prediction are not necessarily the same thing

0:44:39.310,0:44:41.310
You can see this on

0:44:41.440,0:44:45.870
Amazon for example quite often so I bought a terry pratchet book and

0:44:46.210,0:44:50.610
Then Amazon tried for months to get me to buy more terry pratchet books

0:44:50.830,0:44:58.620
now that must be because their predictive model said that people who bought one particular terry patcher book are likely to also by

0:44:58.620,0:45:00.520
other terry pratchet books

0:45:00.520,0:45:04.530
But from the point of view of like well is this going to change my buying behavior?

0:45:05.200,0:45:07.800
Probably not right like if I liked that book

0:45:07.800,0:45:11.999
I already know I like that author and I already know that like they probably wrote other things

0:45:12.000,0:45:15.510
So I'll go and buy it anyway, so this would be an example of like Amazon

0:45:16.450,0:45:19.980
Probably not being very smart up here. They're actually showing me

0:45:20.680,0:45:25.919
Collaborative filtering predictions rather than actually figuring out how to optimize a recommendation

0:45:26.500,0:45:30.510
So an optimized recommendation would be something more like your local

0:45:31.120,0:45:35.399
Human bookseller might do where they might say. Oh you like Terry Pratchett

0:45:35.770,0:45:42.840
Well, let me tell you about other kind of comedy fantasy sci-fi writers on the similar vein who you might not have heard about before

0:45:44.200,0:45:49.139
So the difference between recommendations and predictions is super important

0:45:50.619,0:45:55.079
so I wanted to talk about a really important issue around interpreting models and

0:45:56.170,0:46:01.200
For a case study for this I thought we let's pick something that's actually super important right now

0:46:01.530,0:46:03.689
Which is a model in this paper?

0:46:03.690,0:46:06.960
One of the things we're going to try and do in this course is learn how to read papers

0:46:07.720,0:46:11.730
裕美　ー　ここから
So here is a paper, which you I would love for everybody to read

0:46:12.310,0:46:18.179
Called high temperature and high humidity reduce the transmission of kovat 19. Now. This is a very important issue

0:46:18.730,0:46:21.419
Because if the claim of this paper is true

0:46:21.420,0:46:23.420
then that would mean that this is going to be a

0:46:23.530,0:46:29.159
Seasonal disease and if this is a seasonal disease and it's going to have massive policy implications

0:46:30.880,0:46:36.540
So, let's try and find out how this was modeled and understand how to interpret this model

0:46:38.590,0:46:40.590
So, this is a

0:46:41.530,0:46:45.659
Key picture from the paper and what they've done here is they've

0:46:46.270,0:46:51.119
taken a hundred cities in China and they've plotted the temperature on one axis in

0:46:51.490,0:46:59.070
Celsius and are on the other axis where R is a measure of transmissibility. It says for each person that has this

0:46:59.590,0:47:00.970
disease

0:47:00.970,0:47:02.970
How many people on average will they?

0:47:03.790,0:47:09.749
infect so if R is under 1 then the disease will not spread is over R is

0:47:10.720,0:47:14.010
Higher than like 2 it's going to spread incredibly quickly

0:47:15.369,0:47:20.459
And basically R is going to you know, any high R is going to create an exponential transmission impact

0:47:21.670,0:47:25.590
And you can see in this case. They have plotted a best fit line

0:47:26.350,0:47:28.240
through here

0:47:28.240,0:47:30.750
Them and then they've made a claim that there's some particular

0:47:32.260,0:47:38.699
Relationship in terms of a formula that R is one point nine nine minus 0.02 three times temperature

0:47:39.760,0:47:41.470
so

0:47:41.470,0:47:45.780
very obvious concern I would have looking at this picture is that

0:47:47.560,0:47:53.340
This might just be random maybe there's no relationship at all, but just if you picked a hundred

0:47:54.010,0:47:58.709
Cities at random perhaps they were sometimes show this level of relationship

0:48:00.160,0:48:06.480
So one simple way to kind of see that would be to actually do it in a spreadsheet

0:48:07.780,0:48:08.859
so

0:48:08.859,0:48:16.619
Yes, here is a spreadsheet where what I did was I kind of eyeballed this data and I guessed about what is the main?

0:48:16.839,0:48:24.029
Degrees centigrade I think it's about five and what's about the standard deviation of centigrade? I think it's probably about five as well

0:48:24.819,0:48:28.979
and then I did the same thing for our I think I mean our looks like it's about

0:48:29.260,0:48:34.020
1.9 to me and it looks like the standard deviation of R is probably about 0.5

0:48:35.589,0:48:40.409
So what I then did was I just jumped over here and I created a

0:48:41.440,0:48:42.819
random

0:48:42.819,0:48:47.519
Normal value so a random value from a normal distribution from a normal distribution

0:48:47.530,0:48:53.849
So a bell curve with that particular mean and standard deviation of temperature and that particular

0:48:54.339,0:48:59.699
Mean and standard deviation of R. And so this would be an example of

0:49:00.549,0:49:02.020
a city that

0:49:02.020,0:49:07.889
Might be in this data set of a hundred cities something with nine degrees Celsius and an hour of 1.1

0:49:07.890,0:49:13.349
So that would be nine degrees Celsius and an hour of 1.1. So something about here

0:49:14.950,0:49:18.359
And so then I just copied that formula down

0:49:20.380,0:49:22.380
100 times

0:49:22.420,0:49:25.290
So here are a hundred cities

0:49:25.960,0:49:31.889
that could be in China right where this is assuming that there is no relationship between

0:49:32.260,0:49:35.010
temperature and R right there just random numbers

0:49:36.490,0:49:37.690
and

0:49:37.690,0:49:43.290
So each time I recalculate that so if I hit control equals it will just recalculate it

0:49:44.290,0:49:46.290
Right I get different numbers

0:49:46.839,0:49:49.979
Okay, because they're random and so you can see at the top here

0:49:50.740,0:49:52.740
I've then got the average of

0:49:54.579,0:49:59.339
All of the temperatures and the average of all of the hours and the average of all the temperatures

0:50:02.290,0:50:07.290
Varies and the average of all of the odds varies as well. So then I

0:50:09.040,0:50:12.119
What I did was I copied those random numbers

0:50:14.530,0:50:16.530
Over here

0:50:17.230,0:50:23.490
Let's actually do it so I'll go copy these 100 random numbers and paste them

0:50:25.960,0:50:27.760
Here

0:50:27.760,0:50:33.389
Here here here. And so now I've got

0:50:34.839,0:50:40.979
1 2 3 4 5 6 I've got 6 kind of groups of 100 cities

0:50:41.289,0:50:43.559
all right, and so let's

0:50:45.220,0:50:51.359
Stop those from randomly changing any more by just fixing them in stone there

0:50:57.789,0:51:00.329
Okay, so now that I've pasted them in I've got

0:51:01.030,0:51:08.489
6 examples of what a hundred cities might look like if there was no relationship at all between temperature and R and

0:51:09.579,0:51:13.589
I've got their mean temperature and R in each of those six examples

0:51:13.630,0:51:19.079
And what I've done is you can see here at least for the first one is I've plotted it

0:51:19.630,0:51:22.710
Right and you can see in this case. There's actually a

0:51:23.680,0:51:25.680
slight positive slope and

0:51:26.500,0:51:28.500
I've actually calculated

0:51:30.549,0:51:32.549
The slope

0:51:33.010,0:51:38.010
For each just by using the slope function in Microsoft Excel and you can see that actually

0:51:39.430,0:51:41.430
In this particular case is just random

0:51:42.460,0:51:44.490
Five times it's been

0:51:45.369,0:51:47.818
Negative and it's even more negative than their

0:51:48.460,0:51:50.460
0.023

0:51:50.559,0:51:55.109
And so you can like it's kind of matching our intuition here

0:51:55.109,0:51:58.499
which is that this the slope of the line that we have here is

0:51:59.829,0:52:07.079
Something that absolutely can often happen totally by chance. It doesn't seem to be indicating any kind of real relationship at all

0:52:07.990,0:52:11.819
if we wanted that slope to be like

0:52:12.490,0:52:18.689
More confident we would need to look at more cities. So like here I've got

0:52:21.549,0:52:27.149
3,000 randomly generated numbers and you can see here. The slope is

0:52:28.930,0:52:35.760
0.0002 right. It's almost exactly zero, which is what we'd expect right when there's actually no relationship between C and R

0:52:35.760,0:52:37.949
And in this case there isn't they're all random

0:52:38.740,0:52:44.219
Then if we look at lots and lots of randomly generated cities, then we can say oh, yeah, there's there's no slope

0:52:44.590,0:52:49.379
But when you only look at a hundred as we did here you're going to see relationships

0:52:51.010,0:52:58.139
Totally coincidentally very very often. All right, so that's something that we need to be able to measure and

0:52:58.690,0:53:01.649
So one way to measure that is we use something called a p-value

0:53:02.590,0:53:05.159
So a p-value here's our p-value works

0:53:05.470,0:53:12.600
we start out with something called a null hypothesis and the null hypothesis is basically what's what's our

0:53:13.270,0:53:16.800
starting point assumption so our starting point assumption might be oh

0:53:16.800,0:53:24.179
There's no relationship between temperature and R. And then we gather some data and have you explained what R is I have. Yes

0:53:24.390,0:53:26.390
How is the transmissibility of the virus?

0:53:28.180,0:53:35.310
So then we gather data of independent and dependent variables, so in this case the independent variable is the thing that we think

0:53:36.130,0:53:43.290
Might cause the dependent variable. So here the independent variable would be temperature the dependent variable would be R. So here we've gathered data

0:53:43.990,0:53:46.379
There's the data that was gathered in this example

0:53:46.380,0:53:51.960
And then we say what does centage of the time would we see this amount of relationship?

0:53:51.960,0:53:55.830
which is a slope of 0.02 3 by chance and

0:53:56.260,0:54:00.090
as we've seen one way to do that is by what we would call a

0:54:00.190,0:54:07.260
simulation which is by generating random numbers 100 set pairs of random numbers a bunch of times and seeing how often

0:54:07.510,0:54:09.600
You see this this relationship?

0:54:11.140,0:54:13.830
We don't actually have to do it that though, there's actually a

0:54:14.710,0:54:22.290
Simple equation we can use to jump straight to this number which is what percent of the time would we see that relationship by chance?

0:54:25.150,0:54:27.150
And

0:54:27.580,0:54:31.110
This is basically what that looks like we have the

0:54:31.780,0:54:37.439
Most likely observation which in this case would be if there is no relationship between temperature

0:54:37.590,0:54:40.410
then the most likely slope would be zero and

0:54:41.410,0:54:47.039
sometimes you get positive slopes by chance and sometimes you get

0:54:48.160,0:54:50.219
pretty small slopes and sometimes you get

0:54:51.010,0:54:54.180
large negative slopes by chance and so

0:54:54.520,0:54:55.410
the you know

0:54:55.410,0:55:00.569
the larger the number the less likely it is to happen whether it be on the positive side or the negative side and

0:55:00.910,0:55:02.969
so in our case our question was

0:55:04.390,0:55:10.529
How often are we going to get less than negative 0.02 3 so it would actually be somewhere down here

0:55:10.930,0:55:14.430
And I actually copy this from Wikipedia where they were looking for positive numbers

0:55:14.560,0:55:18.090
And so they've colored in this area above the number

0:55:18.370,0:55:25.380
So this is the p-value and so you can we don't care about the math, but there's a simple little equation you can use to

0:55:25.960,0:55:27.960
directly figure out

0:55:28.780,0:55:32.460
This number the p-value from the data

0:55:34.360,0:55:37.589
So this is kind of how nearly all

0:55:38.710,0:55:41.879
kind of medical research results tend to be shown and

0:55:42.850,0:55:47.519
Folks really focus on this idea of p-values and indeed in this particular study

0:55:48.220,0:55:51.090
As well see in a moment. They reported p-values

0:55:52.120,0:55:57.539
So probably a lot of you have seen p-values in your previous lives. They come up in a lot of different domains

0:55:59.110,0:56:01.110
Here's the thing

0:56:01.180,0:56:05.039
They are terrible you almost always shouldn't be using them

0:56:05.950,0:56:09.119
Don't just trust me trust the American Statistical Association

0:56:10.330,0:56:12.870
They point out six things about p-values

0:56:13.570,0:56:19.529
And those include p-values do not measure the probability that the hypothesis is true

0:56:20.080,0:56:23.610
Or the probability that the data were produced by random choice alone

0:56:24.040,0:56:31.110
now we know this because we just saw that if we use more data, right so if we sample

0:56:32.020,0:56:37.350
Three thousand random cities rather than 100 we get a much

0:56:38.080,0:56:43.080
Smaller value, right? So p-values don't just tell you about how big a relationship is

0:56:43.090,0:56:48.539
But they actually tell you about a combination of that and how much data did you collect? All right, so

0:56:49.060,0:56:53.039
So they don't measure the probability. The hypothesis is true. So therefore

0:56:54.430,0:56:59.610
Conclusions and policy decisions should not be based on whether a p-value passes some threshold

0:57:02.500,0:57:04.500
P-value does not measure

0:57:04.780,0:57:06.780
the importance of a result

0:57:07.150,0:57:10.349
Right because again, it could just tell you that you collected lots of data

0:57:10.810,0:57:18.269
Which doesn't tell you that the results actually of any practical import and so by itself. It does not provide a good measure of evidence

0:57:20.500,0:57:27.840
So Frank Harrell who is somebody who I read his book and it's a really important part of my learning

0:57:27.840,0:57:31.590
He's a professor of biostatistics has a number of great articles about this

0:57:33.370,0:57:34.810
He says

0:57:34.810,0:57:39.029
Null hypothesis, testing and p-values have done significant harm to science

0:57:39.700,0:57:44.520
And he wrote another piece called and the whole hypothesis significance testing never worked

0:57:45.550,0:57:47.230
so

0:57:47.230,0:57:48.730
I've shown you what?

0:57:48.730,0:57:56.070
p-values are so that you know why they don't work not so that you can use them right, but they're a super important part of

0:57:57.010,0:58:03.570
machine learning because they come up all the time in making just you know, when people saying this is how we decide whether

0:58:04.270,0:58:06.630
your drug worked or whether there is a

0:58:07.330,0:58:11.580
Epidemiological relationship or whatever and indeed

0:58:12.220,0:58:14.220
p-values appear in this paper

0:58:14.710,0:58:18.149
so in the paper, they show the results of a

0:58:19.030,0:58:21.030
multiple linear regression

0:58:21.310,0:58:24.840
And they put three stars next to any

0:58:25.480,0:58:29.070
Relationship which has a p-value of 0.01 or less?

0:58:30.880,0:58:32.880
So

0:58:34.420,0:58:39.240
There is something useful to say about a small p-value like 0.01 or less

0:58:40.150,0:58:43.890
Which is the thing that we're looking at did not probably did not happen by chance

0:58:44.440,0:58:46.390
right the biggest

0:58:46.390,0:58:52.259
statistical error people make all the time is that they see that a p-value is not less than

0:58:52.660,0:58:55.080
0.05 and then they make the erroneous

0:58:55.660,0:58:57.660
conclusion that no

0:58:58.090,0:59:00.120
relationship exists, right

0:59:01.060,0:59:05.399
Which doesn't make any sense because like let's say you only had like three data points

0:59:06.039,0:59:11.999
Then you almost certainly won't have enough data to have a p-value of less than 0.05 for any

0:59:13.299,0:59:19.619
Hypothesis, so like the way to check is to go back and say what if I picked the exact opposite null hypothesis

0:59:20.140,0:59:24.210
What if my null hypothesis was there is a relationship between temperature and R

0:59:24.789,0:59:27.059
Then do I have enough data to?

0:59:28.029,0:59:32.129
Reject that null hypothesis. All right, and if the answer is no

0:59:32.950,0:59:34.359
then

0:59:34.359,0:59:38.338
You just don't have enough data to make any conclusions at all. All right

0:59:38.890,0:59:45.569
so in this case, they do have enough data to be confident that there is a relationship between

0:59:46.329,0:59:48.329
temperature and ah

0:59:48.490,0:59:49.779
Now, that's weird

0:59:49.779,0:59:54.989
because we just looked at the graph and we did a little back of a bit of a back-of-the-envelope in Excel and we thought

0:59:55.509,0:59:58.019
This is could it could well be random so

1:00:00.039,1:00:02.039
Here's where the issue is

1:00:02.619,1:00:08.518
the graph shows what we call a univariate relationship a univariate relationship shows the relationship between

1:00:08.890,1:00:13.319
One independent variable and one dependent variable and that's what you can normally show on a graph

1:00:14.019,1:00:16.169
but in this case they did a

1:00:16.990,1:00:19.259
multivariate model in which they looked at temperature and

1:00:20.259,1:00:21.609
humidity and

1:00:21.609,1:00:23.559
GDP per capita and

1:00:23.559,1:00:25.559
population density

1:00:25.599,1:00:33.179
And when you put all of those things into the model, then you end up with statistically significant results for temperature and humidity

1:00:33.730,1:00:37.079
Why does that happen? Well, the reason that happens is because

1:00:38.950,1:00:43.169
All these variation in the blue dots is not random

1:00:43.420,1:00:47.159
There's a reason they're different right and the reasons include

1:00:48.069,1:00:51.538
denser cities are going to have higher transmission for instance and

1:00:52.150,1:00:57.180
Probably more humid who have less transmission. So when you do a

1:00:59.109,1:01:06.689
Multivariate model, it actually allows you to be more confident of your results, right?

1:01:09.309,1:01:16.169
But the p-value as noted by the American Statistical Association does not tell us whether this is a practical importance

1:01:17.109,1:01:21.119
The thing that tells us is this is practical as importance is the actual slope

1:01:21.910,1:01:23.940
That's found and so in this case

1:01:25.930,1:01:33.719
The equation they come up with is that R equals three point nine six eight minus three point

1:01:33.720,1:01:38.130
Oh point O three eight by temperature minus point zero two four by relative humidity

1:01:38.170,1:01:44.909
This is this equation is this practically important? Well, we can again do a little back of the envelope here

1:01:47.710,1:01:49.710
By just putting that into

1:01:50.800,1:01:58.680
Excel let's say there was one place. It had a temperature of ten centigrade and a humidity of forty then if this equation is

1:01:58.680,1:02:00.960
Correct, R would be about two point seven

1:02:01.840,1:02:05.340
Somewhere with the temperature of 35 centigrade and a humidity of eighty

1:02:06.070,1:02:08.070
Will be about point eight

1:02:08.380,1:02:12.630
So is this practically important? Oh my god. Yes, right

1:02:13.360,1:02:16.259
two different cities with different climates

1:02:16.960,1:02:20.369
Can be if they're the same in every other way and this model is correct

1:02:21.010,1:02:28.290
Then one city would have no spread of disease because R is less than 1 1 would have massive exponential explosion

1:02:29.650,1:02:31.000
so

1:02:31.000,1:02:38.400
We can see from this model that if the modeling is correct, then this is a highly practically significant result

1:02:38.400,1:02:43.799
So this is how you determine practical significance of your models is not with p-values

1:02:44.380,1:02:47.579
But with looking at kind of actual outcomes

1:02:48.910,1:02:51.180
So, how do you think about?

1:02:52.360,1:02:54.539
the practical importance

1:02:55.150,1:03:00.420
Of a model and how do you turn a predictive model into something useful in production?

1:03:01.000,1:03:05.880
so I spent many many years thinking about this and I actually

1:03:06.490,1:03:08.230
created a

1:03:08.230,1:03:11.190
With some other great folks actually created a paper about it

1:03:13.330,1:03:15.330
Designing great data products

1:03:17.320,1:03:19.180
And

1:03:19.180,1:03:21.180
This is largely based on

1:03:22.270,1:03:24.840
Ten years of work I did at a company

1:03:24.840,1:03:28.920
I founded called optimal decisions group and optimal decisions group was

1:03:29.230,1:03:33.849
focused on a question of helping insurance companies what prices to set

1:03:34.520,1:03:35.960
and

1:03:35.960,1:03:41.919
Insurance companies up until that point had focused on predictive modeling actuaries in particular

1:03:42.619,1:03:44.619
Spent their time trying to figure out

1:03:46.190,1:03:50.649
How likely is it that you're going to crash your car and if you do how much damage might you have?

1:03:51.440,1:03:55.779
And then based on that try to figure out what price they should set for your policy

1:03:56.809,1:04:01.449
So for this company what we did was we decided to use a different approach

1:04:01.700,1:04:05.950
Which I ended up calling the drivetrain approach which is described here

1:04:06.829,1:04:08.359
to

1:04:08.359,1:04:13.749
Just set insurance prices and indeed to do all kinds of other things and so for the Insurance example

1:04:14.720,1:04:17.709
the objective would be if an insurance company would be

1:04:18.559,1:04:20.559
how do I maximize my

1:04:21.049,1:04:23.049
let's say five-year profit and

1:04:23.539,1:04:28.419
Then what inputs can we control? Can we control which what I call levers?

1:04:29.029,1:04:32.229
so in this case, it would be what price can I set and

1:04:32.779,1:04:39.339
Then data is data, which can tell you as you change your levers. How does that change your objective?

1:04:39.470,1:04:46.299
So if I start increasing my price to people who are likely to crash their car, then will get less of them

1:04:46.299,1:04:52.059
Which means we have less costs, but at the same time we'll also have less revenue coming in. For example

1:04:52.609,1:05:00.369
So to link up there kind of the levers to the objective via the data, we collect we build models that described how the levers

1:05:01.160,1:05:03.160
influence objective and this is all like

1:05:03.740,1:05:08.469
It seems pretty obvious. What do you say it like this, but when we started work with

1:05:09.200,1:05:16.839
Optimal decisions in 1999. Nobody was doing this an insurance everybody in insurance was simply doing a predictive model

1:05:18.020,1:05:23.709
To guess how likely people were to crash their car and then pricing was set by like adding

1:05:24.500,1:05:28.149
20% or whatever. It was just done in a very kind of naive way

1:05:29.329,1:05:31.250
so

1:05:31.250,1:05:32.559
what I did is I a

1:05:32.559,1:05:39.339
You know over many years took this basic process and tried to help lots of companies cigarette how to use it to turn

1:05:40.010,1:05:42.010
predictive models into actions

1:05:43.160,1:05:45.160
so the starting point

1:05:45.170,1:05:51.300
in like actually getting value in a particular model is thinking about what is it you're trying to do and you know

1:05:51.300,1:05:53.519
What are the sources of value in that thing you're trying to do?

1:05:54.190,1:06:00.810
The levers what are the things you can change? Like? What's the point of a predictive model if you can't do anything about it, right?

1:06:02.170,1:06:06.270
Figuring out ways to find what data you you don't have which ones suitable what's available?

1:06:06.460,1:06:09.480
then thinking about what approaches to analytics you can then take

1:06:10.180,1:06:12.180
and then super important like

1:06:12.730,1:06:13.750
well

1:06:13.750,1:06:18.869
Can you actually implement, you know those changes and super super important?

1:06:18.910,1:06:22.500
how do you actually change things as the environment changes and

1:06:22.750,1:06:29.489
You know interestingly a lot of these things areas where there's not very much academic research. There's a little bit and

1:06:31.359,1:06:37.289
Some of the papers that have been particularly around maintenance of like how do you decide when your machine learning model is kind of?

1:06:38.109,1:06:43.919
Still okay. How do you update it over time? I've had like many many many many citations

1:06:44.650,1:06:49.889
But they don't pop up very often because a lot of folks are so focused on the math, you know

1:06:50.859,1:06:55.169
And then there's the whole question of like what constraints are in place across this whole thing

1:06:55.270,1:07:01.259
So what you'll find in the book is there is a whole appendix which actually goes through every one of these

1:07:01.599,1:07:05.068
six things and has a whole list of

1:07:05.770,1:07:09.540
Examples written so this is an example of how to like think about

1:07:11.050,1:07:18.149
Value and lots of questions that companies and organizations can use to try and think about

1:07:19.960,1:07:22.949
You know all of these different pieces of the actual

1:07:24.190,1:07:30.569
Puzzle of getting stuff into production and actually into an effective product. We have a question. Sure just a moment

1:07:30.569,1:07:36.959
so as I say so do check out this appendix because it actually originally appeared as a blog post and I think except for my

1:07:37.540,1:07:40.409
covered 19 posts that I did with Rachel

1:07:40.410,1:07:46.260
it's actually the most popular blog post I've ever written it said hundreds of thousands of views and it kind of represents like

1:07:47.319,1:07:49.180
20 years of hard one

1:07:49.180,1:07:53.700
um insights about like how you actually get value from

1:07:54.190,1:07:59.099
Machine learning and practice and what you actually have to ask. So, please check it out because hopefully you'll find it helpful

1:07:59.930,1:08:01.930
so when we think about like think

1:08:02.870,1:08:10.420
About this for the question of how should people think about the relationship between seasonality and transmissibility of Kovan 19

1:08:13.130,1:08:16.840
You kind of need to dig really deeply into the questions about like oh

1:08:18.200,1:08:22.510
Not just what what's that? What are those numbers in the data? But what does it really look like, right?

1:08:22.510,1:08:27.369
so one of the things in the paper that they show is actual maps right of

1:08:28.040,1:08:29.840
temperature and

1:08:29.840,1:08:32.829
humidity and ah, right and

1:08:33.650,1:08:37.659
you can see like not surprisingly that humidity and

1:08:38.330,1:08:40.330
temperature in China

1:08:40.520,1:08:46.419
What we would call um order correlated which is to say that places that are close to each other in this case

1:08:46.730,1:08:48.939
geographically have similar temperatures and

1:08:49.490,1:08:51.490
similar humidities and

1:08:51.530,1:08:53.270
so like

1:08:53.270,1:08:57.520
This actually puts into the question the a lot the p values

1:08:58.160,1:09:03.519
That they have right because you you can't really think of these as a hundred totally separate cities

1:09:03.920,1:09:07.420
Because the ones that are close to each other probably have very close behavior

1:09:07.420,1:09:10.180
so maybe you should think of them as like a small number of

1:09:10.940,1:09:14.200
Sets of cities, you know of kind of larger geographies

1:09:15.020,1:09:16.370
so

1:09:16.370,1:09:21.700
these are the kinds of things that when you look actually into a model you need to like think about what are the

1:09:22.310,1:09:27.700
What are the limitations but then to decide like well, what does that mean? What do I what do I do about that?

1:09:29.720,1:09:36.340
You you need to think of it from this kind of utility point of view this kind of end to end

1:09:37.070,1:09:40.299
what are the actions I can take order the results point of view not just

1:09:41.210,1:09:44.500
Null hypothesis testing. So in this case, for example

1:09:46.520,1:09:48.760
There are basically four possible

1:09:49.430,1:09:55.570
Key ways. This could end up it could end up that there really is a relationship between

1:09:56.630,1:09:58.630
temperature and R or

1:09:59.720,1:10:05.050
So that's but the right hand side is or there is no real relationship between temperature and R and

1:10:06.350,1:10:09.610
We might act on the assumption that there is a relationship

1:10:10.100,1:10:15.220
Or we might act on the assumption that there isn't a relationship and so you kind of want to look at each of these four

1:10:16.040,1:10:18.040
possibilities and say like well, what would be the

1:10:19.250,1:10:21.250
economic and societal consequences

1:10:22.070,1:10:25.329
And you know, there's gonna be a huge difference in

1:10:26.000,1:10:30.220
Lives lost and you know economy is crashing and whatever else - you know

1:10:30.980,1:10:32.980
for each of these for

1:10:34.760,1:10:40.420
The the paper actually, you know has shown if their model is correct

1:10:40.550,1:10:48.219
What's the likely our value in March feel like every city in the world and the likely our value in July?

1:10:48.950,1:10:53.800
for every city in the world, and so for example, if you look at kind of New England and New York

1:10:54.530,1:11:00.009
The prediction here is and also West cut the other the very coast of the west coast. Is that in July

1:11:01.640,1:11:03.640
The disease will stop spreading

1:11:03.800,1:11:07.090
Now, you know in a that happens if they're right then

1:11:07.880,1:11:13.089
That's gonna be a disaster because I think it's very likely in America and also the UK

1:11:13.790,1:11:15.790
That people will say Oh

1:11:15.980,1:11:21.669
Turns out this disease is not a problem. You know, it didn't really take off at all. The scientists were wrong

1:11:22.160,1:11:25.240
people will go back to their previous day-to-day life and

1:11:25.820,1:11:32.679
We could see what happened in 1918 flu virus of like the second go around when winter hits

1:11:33.740,1:11:35.740
could be much worse than

1:11:36.200,1:11:41.260
Than the start right? So like there's these kind of like huge potential

1:11:42.320,1:11:48.489
policy impacts depending on whether this is true or false and so - think about it -

1:11:49.280,1:11:55.179
Yes. I also just wanted to say that it would be it would be very irresponsible to think. Oh

1:11:55.730,1:11:57.999
Summers gonna solve it. We don't need to act now

1:11:58.760,1:12:05.800
Just in that this is something growing exponentially and could do a huge huge amount of damage. Yeah. Yes. Okay, it already has done

1:12:06.650,1:12:07.450
by the way

1:12:07.450,1:12:11.530
if you assume that there will be seasonality and that

1:12:11.990,1:12:17.949
Summer will fix things then it couldn't beat you to be apathetic. Now if you assume there's no seasonality and

1:12:18.650,1:12:23.949
then there is then you could end up kind of creating a larger level of

1:12:25.210,1:12:30.449
Expectation of destruction that actually happens and end up with your population being even more apathetic, you know

1:12:30.449,1:12:34.559
So that they're you know being wrong in any direction to be a problem. So

1:12:35.350,1:12:40.409
One of the ways we tend to deal with this with with this kind of modeling is we try to think about priors

1:12:41.230,1:12:45.750
So our priors are basically things where we you know, rather than just having a null hypothesis

1:12:46.150,1:12:52.230
We try and start with a guess as to like, well, what's what's more likely right? So in this case?

1:12:54.070,1:13:00.420
If memory serves correctly, I think we know that like flu viruses become inactive at 27 centigrade

1:13:00.730,1:13:03.209
We know that like cold the cold

1:13:04.120,1:13:09.509
Coronaviruses are seasonal the 1918 the 1918 flu

1:13:10.449,1:13:12.250
epidemic was seasonal

1:13:12.250,1:13:17.909
In every country and city that's been studied so far. There's been quite a few studies like this

1:13:17.909,1:13:21.059
They've always found climate relationships so far

1:13:21.159,1:13:25.469
so maybe we'd say well prior belief is that this thing is probably

1:13:25.780,1:13:29.190
Seasonal and so they would say well this particular paper adds

1:13:30.010,1:13:32.010
Some evidence to that

1:13:32.230,1:13:34.230
so like it shows like

1:13:34.300,1:13:38.250
how incredibly complex it is to use a

1:13:39.340,1:13:46.560
Model in practice for in this case policy discussions but also for like organizational decisions

1:13:47.230,1:13:49.230
because you know, there's always

1:13:49.719,1:13:53.759
Complexities there's always uncertainties. And so you actually have to think about the

1:13:54.429,1:13:59.729
The utility, you know and your best guesses and try to combine everything together as best as you can

1:14:00.400,1:14:02.400
okay, so

1:14:03.250,1:14:05.250
With all that said

1:14:07.659,1:14:08.890
It's still

1:14:08.890,1:14:10.890
nice to be able to get our

1:14:11.590,1:14:16.350
our models up and running even if you know even just a predictive model is

1:14:17.170,1:14:22.589
sometimes useful of its own sometimes it's useful to prototype something and sometimes it's just

1:14:23.230,1:14:28.919
It's got to be part of some bigger picture. So rather than try to create some huge into end model here

1:14:28.920,1:14:30.920
We thought we would just show you how to

1:14:31.780,1:14:33.780
get your

1:14:35.020,1:14:37.020
Your PI torch fast AI model

1:14:37.570,1:14:39.000
up and running

1:14:39.000,1:14:45.180
In his raw a form as possible so that from there you can kind of build on top of it as you like

1:14:45.610,1:14:47.610
So to do that

1:14:47.710,1:14:49.510
we are going to

1:14:49.510,1:14:53.699
Download and curate our own data set and you're going to do the same thing

1:14:54.340,1:14:58.139
you've got to train your own model on that data set and then you're going to

1:14:58.960,1:15:02.340
Create an application and then you're going to host it know

1:15:03.100,1:15:05.020
now

1:15:05.020,1:15:10.169
There's lots of ways to create curate an image data set you might have some photos on your own computer

1:15:11.110,1:15:13.110
There might be stuff at work you can use

1:15:15.160,1:15:20.789
One of the easiest though is just to download stuff of the internet there's lots of services for downloading stuff off the internet

1:15:21.640,1:15:26.459
We're going to be using Bing image search here because they're super easy to use

1:15:27.010,1:15:33.119
A lot of the other kind of easy to use things require breaking the Terms of Service of websites

1:15:33.610,1:15:36.869
so like we're not going to show you how to do that, but

1:15:37.420,1:15:40.410
There's lots of examples that do show you how to do that

1:15:40.870,1:15:43.140
So you can check them out as well if you if you want to

1:15:43.690,1:15:47.850
Being image search is actually pretty great at least at the moment these things change a lot

1:15:47.850,1:15:50.430
so keep an eye on our website to see

1:15:51.460,1:15:53.460
If we've changed our recommendation

1:15:53.710,1:16:00.000
The biggest problem with being image search is that the signup process is a nightmare?

1:16:00.730,1:16:06.390
At least at the moment. I feel like one of the hardest parts of this book is just signing up to their damn API

1:16:07.240,1:16:11.610
Which requires going through a sure it's called cognitive services as your cognitive services

1:16:11.710,1:16:17.220
So we'll make sure that all that information is on the website for you to follow through just how to sign up

1:16:17.830,1:16:19.830
So we're going to start from the assumption

1:16:20.410,1:16:22.410
That you've already signed up

1:16:25.060,1:16:27.060
But you can find it just go being

1:16:28.510,1:16:36.090
Being Image Search API and at the moment they give you seven days with a pretty high

1:16:38.140,1:16:41.010
Pretty high quota for free and then after that

1:16:42.430,1:16:44.430
You can keep using it

1:16:44.650,1:16:46.650
as long as you like

1:16:46.750,1:16:53.709
But they kind of limit it to like three transactions per second or something, which is plenty you can still do thousands for free

1:16:53.710,1:16:56.530
So it's at the moment. It's pretty great. Even for free

1:16:58.460,1:16:59.480
So

1:16:59.480,1:17:01.250
What will happen is?

1:17:01.250,1:17:06.220
When you sign up for being image search or any of these kind of services, they'll give you an API key

1:17:06.290,1:17:11.649
So just replace the xxx here with the API key that they give you

1:17:11.750,1:17:14.740
Okay, so that's now going to be called key

1:17:16.070,1:17:18.070
In fact, let's do it over here

1:17:20.060,1:17:24.399
Okay, so you'll put in your key and then there's a

1:17:25.400,1:17:29.530
function we've created called search images Bing, which is just a super tiny little

1:17:31.520,1:17:35.200
Function as you can see, it's just two lines of code. Just trying to save a little bit of time

1:17:37.340,1:17:39.340
Which will take some

1:17:39.470,1:17:44.919
Take your API key and some search term and return a list of URLs that match that search term

1:17:46.160,1:17:48.160
as you can see for

1:17:48.830,1:17:50.510
using

1:17:50.510,1:17:54.609
This particular service. You have to install a particular

1:17:55.730,1:17:59.530
Package, so we show you how to do that on the site as well

1:18:00.380,1:18:02.620
so once you've done so you'll be able to run this and

1:18:03.740,1:18:06.909
That will return by default. I think 150

1:18:07.610,1:18:09.050
URLs

1:18:09.050,1:18:12.969
Okay, so faster Y comes with a download URL function

1:18:12.970,1:18:17.439
So he let's just download one of those images just to check and open it up

1:18:17.440,1:18:22.240
And so what I did was I searched for grizzly bear and here I have a grizzly bear

1:18:24.110,1:18:26.230
So then what I did was I said, okay

1:18:26.230,1:18:32.589
Let's try and create a create a model that can recognize grizzly bears versus black bears versus teddy bears

1:18:33.590,1:18:36.520
So that way I can find out I could set up some video

1:18:38.270,1:18:41.919
Recognition system near our campsite when we're out camping that

1:18:42.530,1:18:43.960
Gives me bear warnings

1:18:43.960,1:18:48.520
But if it's a teddy bear coming then it doesn't warn me and wake me up because that would not be scary at all

1:18:49.460,1:18:52.450
So then I just go through each of those three bear types

1:18:53.030,1:18:54.890
Create a directory

1:18:54.890,1:19:00.669
With the name of grizzly or black or teddy bear searched being for that particular search term

1:19:03.110,1:19:05.000
Along with bear

1:19:05.000,1:19:09.370
And download and so download images is a first day I function as well

1:19:10.430,1:19:13.360
So after that I can call get image files

1:19:13.460,1:19:18.610
Which is a faster a function that will just return recursively all of the image files

1:19:19.040,1:19:24.640
Inside this path and you can see it's given me bears black and then lots of numbers

1:19:27.260,1:19:28.790
So

1:19:28.790,1:19:33.490
one of the things you have to be careful of is that a lot of the stuff you download will turn out to be like

1:19:33.490,1:19:37.990
not images at all and will break so you can call verify images to

1:19:38.450,1:19:41.559
Check that all of these file names are actual images

1:19:42.800,1:19:50.559
And in this case, I didn't have any failed. So there's it's empty. But if you did have some then you would call

1:19:51.920,1:19:58.149
path unlink unlink path to unlink is part of the Python standard library and it deletes a file and

1:19:59.240,1:20:02.169
Map is something that will call this function

1:20:02.990,1:20:06.189
for every element of this collection

1:20:06.830,1:20:08.830
this is part of a

1:20:08.870,1:20:10.730
special

1:20:10.730,1:20:13.450
FASTA a class called L. It's basically

1:20:14.180,1:20:16.570
It's kind of a mix between the Python standard library

1:20:17.330,1:20:23.169
List class and a numpy array class then we'll be learning more about it later in this course

1:20:23.600,1:20:29.769
But it basically tries to make it super easy to do kind of more functional style programming in Python

1:20:30.830,1:20:34.809
So in this case, it's going to unlink every thing that's in the failed

1:20:35.420,1:20:37.420
List, which is probably what we want

1:20:37.880,1:20:42.550
Now because there are all the images that fail to verify. Alright, so we've now got

1:20:43.550,1:20:49.570
a path that contains a whole bunch of images and they're classified according to

1:20:50.510,1:20:54.070
black grizzly or Teddy based on what folder they're in and

1:20:54.680,1:21:01.840
So to create so we're going to create a model and so to create a model. The first thing we need to do is to

1:21:02.360,1:21:04.280
Tell fast AI

1:21:04.280,1:21:07.419
What kind of data we have and how its structured?

1:21:08.690,1:21:15.550
Now in part in lesson 1 of the course, we did that by using what we call a factory method

1:21:15.620,1:21:22.359
Which is we just said image data loader start from name and it did it all for us

1:21:23.869,1:21:26.289
Those factory methods are fine for

1:21:27.020,1:21:30.159
Beginners, but now we're into lesson two. We're not quite beginners anymore

1:21:30.170,1:21:35.799
So we're going to show you the super super flexible way to use data in whatever format you like

1:21:35.960,1:21:40.119
And it's called the data block API. And so the data block API

1:21:45.050,1:21:47.800
Looks like this here's the data block API

1:21:49.340,1:21:55.600
You tell first AI what your independent variable is and what your dependent variable is

1:21:55.600,1:22:02.019
So what your labels are and what your input data is. So in this case our input data are images

1:22:03.170,1:22:08.619
And our labels are categories. So category is going to be either grizzly or black

1:22:09.260,1:22:11.179
or teddy

1:22:11.179,1:22:13.239
So that's the first thing you tell it now

1:22:13.239,1:22:19.178
That's the block's parameter and then you tell it how do you get a list of all of the in this case file names?

1:22:19.520,1:22:24.759
Right, and we just saw how to do that because Peters called the function ourselves if the function is called get image files

1:22:24.889,1:22:28.149
so we tell it what function to use to get that list of items and

1:22:29.090,1:22:34.989
Then you tell it how do you split the data into a validation set and a training set?

1:22:34.989,1:22:39.968
And so we're going to use something called a random spitter which just spits it randomly and we're going to point

1:22:40.130,1:22:42.130
30% of it into the validation set

1:22:42.469,1:22:48.669
we're also going to set the random seed which ensures that every time we run this the validation set will be the same and

1:22:49.760,1:22:55.389
Then you say okay. How do you label the data? And this is the name of a function called parent label?

1:22:55.389,1:22:57.789
And so that's going to look for each

1:22:59.300,1:23:05.560
Item at the name of the parent so this this particular one would become a black bear now

1:23:05.560,1:23:07.560
This is like the most common way for

1:23:09.469,1:23:16.178
Image datasets to be represented is that they get put the different images get the files get put into folder according to their label

1:23:17.119,1:23:18.679
and

1:23:18.679,1:23:21.579
Then finally here we've got something called item transforms

1:23:21.920,1:23:25.359
we're be learning a lot more about transforms in a moment that these are basically

1:23:25.580,1:23:33.070
functions that get applied to each image and so each image is going to be resized to 100 and twenty-eight by

1:23:33.560,1:23:35.560
128 square

1:23:35.960,1:23:38.950
So we're going to be learning more about datablock api soon

1:23:39.200,1:23:44.619
but basically the process is going to be it's going to call whatever is get items which is a list of image files and

1:23:45.650,1:23:50.320
Then I'm going to call get X get Y. So in this case, there's no get X but there is a get Y

1:23:50.320,1:23:55.659
So it's just parent label and then it's going to call the create method for each of these two things

1:23:55.660,1:23:57.789
It's going to create an image and it's going to create a category

1:23:58.520,1:24:01.990
Instead. I'm going to call the item transforms, which is resize

1:24:02.930,1:24:06.249
And then the next thing it does is it puts it into something called a data loader?

1:24:06.250,1:24:10.030
A data loader is something that grabs a few images at a time?

1:24:10.400,1:24:14.890
I think by default at 64 and puts them all into a single

1:24:14.890,1:24:19.090
It's got a batch. It just grabs 64 images and sticks them all together

1:24:19.760,1:24:23.499
And the reason it does that is it then puts them all onto the GPU at once

1:24:24.380,1:24:26.920
so it can pass them all to the

1:24:27.230,1:24:33.640
Model through the GPU in one go and that's going to let the GPU go much faster as we'll be learning about

1:24:34.730,1:24:36.879
And then finally, we don't use any here

1:24:37.190,1:24:43.960
We can have something called batch transforms, which we will talk about later and then somewhere in the mineral about here

1:24:44.480,1:24:51.250
Conceptually is the splitter which is the thing that splits into the training set and the validation set

1:24:51.410,1:24:55.209
So this is a super flexible way to tell fast AI

1:24:56.510,1:25:00.489
how to work with your data and so at the end of that

1:25:01.280,1:25:08.199
It returns an object of type data loaders. That's why we always call these things deals, right?

1:25:08.390,1:25:12.579
So data loaders has a validation and a training

1:25:12.860,1:25:14.150
data loader and

1:25:14.150,1:25:20.470
a data loader as I just mentioned is something that grabs a batch of a few items at a time and puts it on the

1:25:20.470,1:25:22.250
GPU for you

1:25:22.250,1:25:26.530
So this is basically the entire code of data loaders

1:25:27.470,1:25:31.269
So the details don't matter. I just wanted to point out that like a lot of these

1:25:31.850,1:25:34.629
Concepts in fast AI when you actually look at what they are

1:25:34.630,1:25:36.460
They're they're incredibly simple

1:25:36.460,1:25:42.100
but all things it's literally something that you just pass in a few data loaders to edit store some in an attribute and

1:25:42.410,1:25:47.359
Pass and gives you the first one backers train and second one backers valid

1:25:49.199,1:25:51.090
So

1:25:51.090,1:25:53.210
we can create our

1:25:55.230,1:26:02.359
Data loaders by first of all creating the data block and then we call the data loaders passing in our path to create deals and

1:26:02.940,1:26:05.029
Then you can call show batch on that

1:26:05.030,1:26:10.280
You can call show bachelor pretty much anything in fast AI to see your data and look we've got some Grizzlies

1:26:10.280,1:26:12.280
We've got a teddy we've got a grizzly

1:26:14.280,1:26:16.280
So you get the idea right

1:26:17.880,1:26:22.699
I'm going to look at these different. I'm going to look at data augmentation next week

1:26:22.699,1:26:27.469
So I'm going to skip over data-orientation and let's just jump straight into trading your model

1:26:31.710,1:26:35.089
So once we've got two yells we can just like in

1:26:35.760,1:26:39.199
Lesson one call CNN learner to create a

1:26:39.719,1:26:43.038
Resonate we're going to create a smaller resonant this time or isn't it 18?

1:26:43.590,1:26:49.519
Again asking for error rate we can then call dot fine-tune again. So you see it's all the same lines of code

1:26:49.519,1:26:50.999
we've already seen and

1:26:50.999,1:26:55.819
You can see our error rate goes down from nine to one. So we've got one percent error

1:26:56.519,1:27:02.719
And after training for about 25 seconds, so you can see you know, we've only got 450 images

1:27:03.690,1:27:10.789
we've trained for well less than a minute and we only have let's look at the confusion matrix so we can say I

1:27:11.400,1:27:18.559
Want to create a classification interpretation class. I want to look at the confusion matrix and the confusion matrix as you can see

1:27:18.659,1:27:21.768
It's something that says for things that are actually black bears

1:27:22.650,1:27:24.769
How many are predicted to be black bears?

1:27:25.559,1:27:26.610
versus

1:27:26.610,1:27:28.610
grizzly bears versus

1:27:28.679,1:27:33.859
Teddy bears. So the diagonal are the ones that are all correct. And so it looks like we've got two errors

1:27:33.860,1:27:38.150
We've got one grizzly that was predicted be black one black that was predictable grizzly

1:27:40.889,1:27:42.889
Super super useful

1:27:43.469,1:27:47.239
Method is plot top losses, and that'll actually show me

1:27:48.809,1:27:56.119
What my errors actually look like so this one here was predicted to be a grizzly bear but the label was black bear

1:27:56.770,1:28:00.450
This one was the one that's predictably a black bear and the label was grizzly bear

1:28:02.500,1:28:04.800
These ones here are not actually wrong there

1:28:04.830,1:28:11.160
this is predicted to be black and it's actually black but the reason they appear in this is because these are the ones that the

1:28:12.730,1:28:15.540
Model was the least confident about

1:28:16.780,1:28:19.829
Okay, so we're going to look at the image classifier cleaner next week

1:28:20.800,1:28:23.789
Let's focus on how we then get this into production

1:28:24.700,1:28:25.930
so

1:28:25.930,1:28:27.930
To get it into production

1:28:28.150,1:28:30.150
We need to

1:28:30.580,1:28:38.519
Export the model. So what exporting the model does is it creates a new file which by default is called export pickle?

1:28:39.280,1:28:41.170
Which contains?

1:28:41.170,1:28:43.920
The architecture and all of the parameters of the model

1:28:44.170,1:28:50.160
so that is now something that you can copy over to a server somewhere and

1:28:50.710,1:28:52.710
treat it as a

1:28:52.900,1:29:00.030
Predefined program right? So then so the the process of using your trained model

1:29:01.150,1:29:04.920
On new data kind of in production is called inference

1:29:05.410,1:29:10.019
So here I've created an inference learner by loading that learner back again

1:29:10.390,1:29:17.640
All right, and so obviously it doesn't make sense to do it right next to after I've saved it in a notebook

1:29:17.640,1:29:23.459
But I'm just showing you how it work. Right? So this is something that you would do on your server in inference and

1:29:24.730,1:29:31.470
Remember that once you have trained a model, you can just treat it as a program you can pass inputs to it

1:29:31.470,1:29:33.990
So this is now our our program

1:29:33.990,1:29:40.590
this is our Bayer predictor so I can now call predict on it and I can pass it an image and

1:29:41.200,1:29:43.200
It will tell me

1:29:43.210,1:29:45.210
Here is it is?

1:29:45.490,1:29:47.999
99.999% sure that this is a grizzly

1:29:49.240,1:29:53.280
So I think what we're going to do here is we're going to wrap it up here

1:29:54.160,1:29:57.180
And next week we'll finish off by

1:29:58.750,1:30:00.750
Creating an actual GUI

1:30:01.180,1:30:02.680
for our

1:30:02.680,1:30:04.510
bear classifier

1:30:04.510,1:30:06.370
We will

1:30:06.370,1:30:08.140
show how to

1:30:08.140,1:30:10.140
Run it for free on a service call

1:30:10.920,1:30:12.570
binder

1:30:12.570,1:30:14.570
and

1:30:16.530,1:30:23.150
Yeah, and then I think we'll be ready to dive into some of the some of the details of what's going on behind the scenes

1:30:23.849,1:30:27.379
Um any questions or anything else before we wrap up Rachel?

1:30:28.860,1:30:34.339
Now, okay, great. All right. Thanks everybody. So we

1:30:37.409,1:30:39.679
Hopefully, yeah, I think from here on

1:30:40.830,1:30:42.179
We've covered

1:30:42.179,1:30:49.279
You know, most of the key kind of underlying foundational stuff from a machine-learning point of view that we're going to need to cover

1:30:51.000,1:30:53.060
So we'll be able to ready to dive into

1:30:54.840,1:30:58.310
Lower-level details of how deep learning works behind the scenes

1:31:00.540,1:31:03.889
And I think that'll be starting from next week, so see you then
